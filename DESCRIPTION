Description: This data package collects anticancer drug information from 
    multiple resources, including Open Targets Platform/ChEMBL, NCI Thesaurus, 
    and PubChem. The main dataset contains a list of all molecularly targeted
    anticancer drugs per indication/tumor type (where this is provided), 
    which can be queried with a range of parameters, including 
    clinical development phase, approval status, drug targets, 
    mechanism-of-action/drug category etc. The package 
    also allows for the retrieval of curated biomarkers from multiple 
    freely available resources (CIViC, CGI, Mitelman database).
