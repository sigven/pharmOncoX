**pharmOncoX** is an R package that provides access to targeted and non-targeted cancer drugs, and genomic cancer biomarkers. Cancer drugs include comprehensive annotations per target, drug mechanism-of-action, approval dates, clinical trial phases for various indications etc. Drugs are further classified according to the [Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System](https://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index/), enabling a filtering of cancer drugs according to their main types of action. The package also provides access to data on actionable genomic aberrations (i.e. molecular biomarkers), including gene fusions, mutations, copy number alterations, and expression biomarkers.
