Selumetinib is an ATP-independent inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK or MAPK/ERK kinase) 1 and 2. MEK 1 and 2 are dual specificity kinases that are essential mediators in the activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, are often upregulated in various cancer cells, and are drivers of diverse cellular responses, including proliferation. Inhibition of both MEK1 and 2 by selumetinib prevents the activation of MEK1/2 dependent effector proteins and transcription factors, thereby leading to an inhibition of cellular proliferation in various cancers.","An orally available inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 and 2 (MEK1/2) with potential antineoplastic activity. Binimetinib, noncompetitive with ATP, binds to and inhibits the activity of MEK1/2. Inhibition of MEK1/2 prevents the activation of MEK1/2 dependent effector proteins and transcription factors, which may result in the inhibition of growth factor-mediated cell signaling. This may eventually lead to an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and an inhibition in production of various inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1, -6 and tumor necrosis factor. MEK1/2 are dual-specificity threonine/tyrosine kinases that play key roles in the activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway and are often upregulated in a variety of tumor cell types.","An orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MAP2K1 or MEK1), with potential antineoplastic activity. Cobimetinib specifically binds to and inhibits the catalytic activity of MEK1, resulting in inhibition of extracellular signal-related kinase 2 (ERK2) phosphorylation and activation and decreased tumor cell proliferation. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that this agent is effective in inhibiting the growth of tumor cells bearing a B-RAF mutation, which has been found to be associated with many tumor types.

Upon administration, renvistobart binds to TIGIT expressed on various immune cells, particularly on tumor-infiltrating T-lymphocytes (TILs), thereby preventing the interaction of TIGIT with its ligands CD112 (nectin-2; poliovirus receptor related-2; PVRL2) and CD155 (poliovirus receptor; PVR; nectin-like protein 5; NECL-5). This enhances the interaction of CD112 and CD155 with the costimulatory receptor CD226 (DNAX Accessory molecule-1; DNAM-1), which is expressed on immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T-cells, and leads to CD226 dimerization and CD226-mediated signaling.

The binding of NTX-1088 to CD226 prevents the internalization of CD226 and restores its expression on the surface of immune cells. This promotes CD226-dependent signaling pathways, which may trigger the activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and activate T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells, and result in an enhanced cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated and NK cell-mediated immune response against tumor cells.

Upon administration, anti-PD-L1/PD-L2 bispecific antibody IMGS-001 simultaneously targets and binds to PD-L1 and PD-L2 expressed on tumor cells, immunosuppressive stromal cells and endothelial cells. PD-L1 and PD-L2 binding by IMGS-001 prevents both PD-L1 and PD-L2 from binding to and activating their receptor programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279; programmed death-1). This abrogates PD-1-mediated signaling in T-cells and PD-1-mediated T-cell inhibition. This activates cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which may lead to a reduction in tumor growth. In addition, IMGS-001 induces antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), thereby killing PD-L1 and PD-L2-expressing cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and further abrogating the immunosuppressive nature of the TME. PD-L1 and PD-L2 binding to PD-1 on activated T-cells inhibits the expansion and survival of CD8-positive T-cells, suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion.","A fusion protein composed of a recombinant human monoclonal antibody targeting the negative immunoregulatory human cell receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279) fused to a prodrug for the immunostimulatory cytokine interleukin-15 (IL-15), composed of a potency reduced, mutein form of interleukin (IL)-15 complexed with the high-affinity IL-15 receptor alpha (IL-15Ra) binding sushi domain, that is masked by a protease-cleavable masking protein, with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory, immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration of anti-PD-1-IL-15 prodrug fusion molecule ASKG915, the PD-1 targeting moiety specifically targets, binds to and inhibits PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore immune function through the activation of T-cells and a T-cell-mediated immune response against tumor cells. Upon cleavage of the protease-cleavable linker by proteases overexpressed in the tumor environment (TME), the IL-15 mutein moiety binds to the IL-15 receptor and activates IL-15-mediated signaling. This stimulates the proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) and memory T-cells locally in the TME, and further induces an anti-tumor immune response. This may increase tumor cell killing and decrease tumor cell proliferation. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) expressed on T-cells, functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274) or 2 (PD-L2; CD273); it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity. IL-15 regulates CD8+ T and NK cell development, activation and proliferation. The IL-15 mutein form lowers systemic toxicity of IL-15. Protease-dependent activation of IL-15 increases its efficacy and decreases systemic toxicity. IL-15Ra complexed with IL-15 domain improves stability and increases the half-life of IL-15.","A bispecific antibody targeting both the human negative immunoregulatory checkpoint receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279) and the T-cell surface antigen CD3, with potential immunomodulatory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, anti-PD-1/anti-CD3 bispecific antibody ONO-4685 binds to both PD-1 expressed on activated T- and B-cells and certain malignant T-cells and CD3 antigen on cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). This may activate and redirect CTLs to PD-1-expressing cells, resulting in CTL-mediated killing of these cells. This may lead to anti-tumor activity in some T-cell lymphomas, and immunomodulatory activity in some autoimmune diseases.","A preparation of autologous human T-lymphocytes engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) composed of a modified from of the human inhibitory receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1), in which the intracellular signal domain of PD-1 is transformed to allow for stimulatory signaling but with an intact extracellular ligand binding domain that specifically binds the tumor-associated antigen (TAA) programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), and a modified form of the T-cell inhibitory receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), with a transformed intracellular signal domain to allow for stimulatory signaling, which specifically binds the B7 proteins CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2), with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Usually, ligand binding to PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibits T-cell activity; however, these modified forms of PD-1 and CTLA-4 promote T-cell stimulatory signaling. Upon administration, the autologous PD-L1/CD80/CD86-targeted CAR-T cells target and bind to PD-L1 expressed on certain tumor cells and to CD80/CD86 expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This stimulates T-cell activation, T-cell proliferation and enhanced cytokine production, which induces selective toxicity in tumor cells expressing PD-L1. PD-1, found on activated T-cells, negatively regulates T-cell activity; it plays a key role in immune evasion and prevents tumor cell lysis. PD-L1 is often overexpressed on tumor cell types and plays a key role in immune evasion. The co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 play a key role in T-lymphocyte activation upon binding to CD28 upon antigen recognition; however, binding of CD80 and CD86 to wild-type CTLA-4 inhibits T-cell activity and results in T-cell exhaustion.","A bispecific antibody targeting both the human negative immunoregulatory checkpoint receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279) and 4-1BB (CD137; tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 9; TNFRSF9), with potential checkpoint inhibitory, immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, anti-PD-1/anti-4-1BB bispecific antibody IBI-319 simultaneously targets and binds to PD-1, which is expressed on a variety of leukocyte subsets including activated T-lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and 4-1BB, which is expressed on activated T-lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. This crosslinks PD-1- and 4-1BB-expressing T cells. Through 4-1BB binding, IBI-319 acts as a conditional 4-1BB agonist, resulting in T-cell co-stimulation and enhances T-lymphocyte-mediated anti-tumor activity. At the same time, PD-1 binding prevents PD-L1 from binding to and activating its receptor PD-1 and inhibits the PD-L1/PD-1-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation and proliferation. This abrogates T-cell inhibition, activates antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which may lead to a reduction in tumor growth. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on activated T-cells inhibits the expansion and survival of CD8-positive T-cells, suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion. 4-1BB, a surface glycoprotein of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, is an inducible costimulatory receptor that plays a key role in T-cell proliferation, survival and cytolytic activity.","A bispecific antibody composed of a Fc-silenced human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody targeting human programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) fused with a single chain variable fragment (scFv) targeting 4-1BB (CD137; tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 9; TNFRSF9), with potential checkpoint inhibitory, immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, anti-PD-L1/anti-4-1BB bispecific antibody ABL503 simultaneously targets and binds to 4-1BB, which is expressed on a variety of leukocyte subsets including activated T-lymphocytes, and PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells. Upon PD-L1 binding, the 4-1BB activation signal is induced and ABL503 acts as a conditional 4-1BB agonist in the tumor microenvironment (TME), resulting in T-cell co-stimulation and enhances T-lymphocyte-mediated anti-tumor activity. At the same time, ABL503 prevents PD-L1 from binding to and activating its receptor, programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279; programmed death-1). This abrogates T-cell inhibition, activates antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which may lead to a reduction in tumor growth. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on activated T-cells inhibits the expansion and survival of CD8-positive T-cells, suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion. 4-1BB, a surface glycoprotein of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, is an inducible costimulatory receptor that plays a key role in T-cell proliferation, survival and cytolytic activity.","A fusion protein composed of a pentameric immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody directed against the immunosuppressive ligand programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274) fused to interleukin (IL)-15/IL-15 receptor alpha (IL-15Ra) complex, with potential immunostimulatory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration of the anti-PD-L1 antibody/IL-15 fusion protein IGM-7354, the anti-PD-L1 antibody moiety specifically targets and binds to PD-L1 expressing cancer cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME), thereby delivering IL-15 to PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. In turn, the IL-15 stimulates the proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) and memory T-cells locally, and reverses T-cell exhaustion. This induces an anti-tumor immune response in the TME against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. PD-L1, a transmembrane protein, is expressed on APCs and on various cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding to PD-1, a negative regulator of the immune system on activated T-cells, limits the expansion and survival of CD8-positive T-cells, suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion. The immunostimulatory cytokine IL-15 regulates CD8+ T- and NK cell development, activation, and proliferation. IL-15Ra complexed with IL-15 increases the half-life of IL-15. By binding to PD-L1-expressing cells in the TME, IGM-7354 enhances its IL-15-mediated activity on the immune system locally and increases its efficacy while reducing systemic toxicities.","A bispecific antibody targeting both the immunosuppressive ligand programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory, anti-angiogenic and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, anti-PD-L1/anti-VEGF-A bispecific antibody PM8002 targets and simultaneously binds to both PD-L1 and VEGF-A expressed on tumor cells. This prevents the binding of PD-L1 to its receptor, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279), inhibits the PD-1-mediated signaling, and inhibits the PD-1-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation and proliferation. This restores and enhances a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against tumor cells. The binding of PM8002 to VEGF-A prevents the binding of VEGF-A to VEGF receptor (VEGFR), thereby preventing the activation of VEGF-A/VEGFR-mediated signaling pathways. This prevents angiogenesis and may halt tumor cell proliferation. PD-L1 is overexpressed in many human cancer cell types and plays an important role in the downregulation of the immune system and tumor evasion from host immunity. VEGF-A is upregulated in a variety of cancer cell types and plays a crucial role in angiogenesis.","A fixed-dose co-formulation composed of pembrolizumab, a humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody directed against human cell surface receptor PD-1 (programmed death-1; programmed cell death-1; cluster of differentiation 279; CD279), and MK-5180, a recombinant form of human hyaluronidase, with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon subcutaneous administration of recombinant human hyaluronidase and pembrolizumab, the hyaluronidase reversibly depolymerizes the polysaccharide hyaluronan in the subcutaneous tissue. This increases the permeability of the subcutaneous tissue and enhances the absorption of pembrolizumab into the systemic circulation. In turn, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T-cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274), overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and plays a key role in in tumor evasion from host immunity. When administered subcutaneously, hyaluronidase, an endoglycosidase, increases the dispersion and absorption of co-administered drugs.","A bispecific antibody directed against the human negative immunoregulatory checkpoint receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PD1; PDCD1; CD279) and human transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) receptor II (TGFbRII), with potential immune checkpoint modulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, anti-PD-1/anti-TGFbRII bispecific antibody INCA33890 targets and binds to both PD-1 and TGFbRII and prevents the activation of PD-1 and TGF-beta-mediated signaling pathways in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The binding of INCA33890 to PD-1 prevents the activation of PD-1 by its ligands, programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; CD274) and/or 2 (PD-L2; CD273). This abrogates T-cell inhibition, activates antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated tumor cell lysis, which may lead to a reduction in tumor growth. The binding of INCA33890 to TGFbRII prevents the binding of TGF-beta to TGFbRII, thereby preventing the activation of the TGF-beta-mediated signaling pathway. This abrogates TGF-beta-mediated immunosuppression in the TME, increases natural killer (NK) cell and CTL activities, and inhibits tumor cell proliferation in susceptible tumor cells. PD-1, an inhibitory receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), is expressed on activated T-lymphocytes; it functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands and plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity. TGF-beta, a pro-inflammatory mediator, is upregulated in certain types of cancers and is involved in cancer cell proliferation, tumor progression, migration and invasion, and the suppression of the immune response.","A bispecific antibody fusion protein composed of a monoclonal antibody targeting the negative immunoregulatory human cell receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279) and fused to a mutated form of the endogenous cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2), with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, anti-PD-1/IL-2 bispecific antibody fusion protein IBI363 targets and binds to PD-1 expressed on PD-1-expressing T-cells, thereby inhibiting PD-1-mediated signaling. This may restore immune function through the activation of T-cells and T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. IL-2 targets and binds to the IL-2 receptor IL2R and activates IL-2/IL-2R-mediated signaling, which further activates cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells, and induces expression of certain cytotoxic cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFNg) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFb). This further enhances T-cell-mediated cytotoxic immune responses against tumor cells. By selectively activating PD-1 positive T-cells by IL-2, but not PD-1 negative bystander or na\u001a\u001ave T cells, the activity of tumor specific T-cells is specifically enhanced while IL-2-induced systemic toxicity is decreased. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) expressed on T-cells, functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274) or 2 (PD-L2); it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.","A bifunctional fusion protein targeting both the human negative immunoregulatory checkpoint receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279) and human transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta; TGFb), with potential immune checkpoint modulating, immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, anti-PD-1/TGF-beta RII bifunctional fusion protein JS201 targets and binds to PD-1 and TGF-beta and prevents the activation of PD-1 and TGF-beta-mediated signaling pathways in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This abrogates the PD-1- and TGFb-mediated immunosuppression in the TME, increases natural killer (NK) cell and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activities, and inhibits tumor cell proliferation in susceptible tumor cells. PD-1, an inhibitory receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), is expressed on activated T-lymphocytes; it functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands, and plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity. TGF-beta, a pro-inflammatory mediator, is upregulated in certain types of cancers and is involved in cancer cell proliferation, tumor progression and the suppression of the immune response.","A genetically modified oncolytic virus (OV) composed of a replication competent orthopoxviral chimera engineered to express the human sodium iodine symporter (hNIS) and a human monoclonal antibody directed against the immunosuppressive ligand and immune checkpoint inhibitor programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274), with potential oncolytic, immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities that can be used for radioimaging upon positron emission tomography (PET) and radiotherapeutic applications. Upon subcutaneous (SC) intratumoral (IT) administration of the oncolytic virus CF33-expressing hNIS/anti-PD-L1 antibody, the oncolytic virus specifically infects and replicates in tumor cells causing viral-mediated tumor cell lysis. The released virus particles, in turn, infect and replicate in neighboring tumor cells. Tumor antigens released from the lysed tumor cells also activate the immune system to induce a tumor-specific systemic immune and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response, thereby killing nearby non-infected tumor cells. In addition, the anti-PD-L1 antibody produced by the infected tumor cells targets and binds to PD-L1, blocking its binding to and activation of its receptor programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; cluster of differentiation 279; CD279), a transmembrane protein and negative regulator of the immune system, expressed on activated T-cells. This reverses T-cell inactivation caused by PD-1/PD-L1 signaling and enhances the CTL-mediated anti-tumor immune response against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells, thereby further killing tumor cells. Upon subsequent administration of certain iodine-containing imaging agents, hNIS expression by the infected tumor cells allows visualization and tracking of viral biodistribution, and analysis and quantification of CF33-infected tumor cells by PET. Also, administration of iodine I 131 results in its uptake by hNIS-expressing tumor cells, which may result in the selective accumulation of a cytotoxic dose of radiation in tumor cells while sparing adjacent normal tissue.","A bifunctional fusion protein directed against both the negative immunoregulatory human cell receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta; TGFb), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities.

Upon administration, anti-PD-L1/anti-TGF-beta bifunctional fusion protein TQB2858 targets, binds to and neutralizes TGF-beta on tumor cells and simultaneously targets, binds to, and inhibits the activity of PD-L1 on the tumor cells. This prevents both TGF-beta- and PD-L1-mediated immunosuppressive pathways signaling, and increases natural killer (NK) cell and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activities. This also restores and enhances anti-tumor responses and inhibits tumor cell proliferation in susceptible tumor cells. TGF-beta and PD-L1 are both upregulated in certain types of cancers; their overexpression is associated with increased evasion of immune surveillance and contributes to poor prognosis.","A fixed dose combination of two monoclonal antibodies of which one is directed against the human negative immunoregulatory checkpoint receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279) and the other one is directed against the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4; CTLA-4), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities.

This restores immune function and activates a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against tumor cells. Both PD-1 and CTLA-4 are selectively expressed on TILs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and negatively regulate the activation and effector functions of T-cells. They play key roles in the downregulation of the immune system and tumor evasion from host immunity. Dual checkpoint blockade of PD-1 and CTLA-4 enhances T-cell activation and proliferation more than the blockade of either immune checkpoint receptor alone.","A fixed dose combination of two monoclonal antibodies of which one is directed against the human negative immunoregulatory checkpoint receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279) and the other one is directed against the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4; CTLA-4), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities.

Upon administration, anti-PD-L1/anti-VEGF bispecific antibody fusion protein B1962 targets and simultaneously binds to both PD-L1 and VEGF expressed on tumor cells. This prevents the binding of PD-L1 to its receptor, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1, CD279), inhibits the PD-1-mediated signaling, and inhibits the PD-1-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation and proliferation. This restores and enhances a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against VEGF-expressing tumor cells. The binding of B1962 to VEGF prevents the binding of VEGF to its receptor VEGFR, abrogates VEGF/VEGFR-mediated signaling and may lead to the inhibition of vascular endothelial cell proliferation. The inhibition of tumor angiogenesis may further decrease tumor cell proliferation and prevent metastasis. PD-L1 is overexpressed in many human cancer cell types and plays an important role in the downregulation of the immune system and tumor evasion from host immunity. VEGF is overexpressed in a variety of cancers and is associated with increased invasiveness and decreased survival.","A genetically engineered oncolytic herpes simplex virus type 1 (oHSV-1) expressing the human immunostimulating cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) and an antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities.

The released virus particles, in turn, infect and replicate in neighboring tumor cells. Tumor antigens released from the lysed tumor cells also activate the immune system to induce a tumor-specific systemic immune and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response, thereby killing nearby non-infected tumor cells. In addition, oHSV-1 expressing IL-12 and anti-PD-1 antibody T3011 promotes the secretion of IL-12 and anti-PD-1 antibody by the tumor cells. IL-12 promotes the activation of natural killer cells, which induces both the secretion of interferon-gamma and a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against the tumor cells. This results in both immune-mediated tumor cell death and further inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. Anti-PD-1 antibody targets, binds to and inhibits PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore immune function through the activation of T-cells and T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) expressed on T-cells, functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) or 2 (PD-L2); it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.","A recombinant fusion protein consisting of a human monoclonal antibody directed against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4; CTLA-4) fused to the immunostimulatory cytokine interleukin-15 (IL-15) cross-linked with the sushi domain of IL-15 receptor alpha (IL-15Ra), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration of anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody-IL-15/IL-15Ra fusion protein JK08, the monoclonal antibody domain targets and binds to CTLA-4 expressed on T-cells and inhibits the CTLA-4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation. The IL-15/IL-15Ra complex targets and binds to CD8+ T and natural killer (NK) cells, thereby increasing their activation and proliferation. Altogether, this leads to an inhibition of regulatory T-cell (Tregs)-mediated immunosuppression, induces antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), increases memory T-cells and enhances a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against cancer cells. CTLA-4, an inhibitory receptor and member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), plays a key role in the downregulation of the immune system.","An autologous dendritic cell (DC) cancer vaccine with potential immunostimulatory activity. Anti-CTLA4 MoAb RNA-transfected autologous DC vaccine is prepared by transfecting DCs with RNAs encoding humanized heavy and light chains of the anti-CTLA4 (cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Antigen 4); expression of anti-CTLA4 blocks the inhibitory effect of CTLA4 on the activation of T-lymphocytes. Co-vaccination of this vaccine with melanoma antigen specific vaccine may eliminate the adverse effects associated with systemic administration of immune modulators, while also enhancing vaccine-induced immune responses.","A genetically engineered oncolytic herpes simplex virus type 1 (oHSV-1) expressing the human immunostimulating cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) and an antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon intratumoral administration into the glioma, oHSV-1 expressing IL-12 and anti-PD-1 antibody MVR-C5252 specifically infects and replicates in glioma cells causing viral-mediated glioma cell lysis. The released virus particles, in turn, infect and replicate in neighboring glioma cells, thereby further killing tumor cells. Tumor antigens released from the lysed tumor cells also activate the immune system to induce a tumor-specific systemic immune and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response, thereby killing nearby non-infected glioma cells. In addition, as MVR-C5252 carries exogenous genes, it is also able to express IL-12 and anti-PD-1 antibody and are released by the infected cells, both of which are able to promote an immune response in the tumor microenvironment (TME). IL-12 promotes the activation of natural killer cells, which induces both the secretion of interferon-gamma and a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against uninfected glioma cells. This results in both immune-mediated tumor cell death and further inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. The anti-PD-1 antibody targets, binds to and inhibits PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore immune function through the activation of T-cells and T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) expressed on T-cells, functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) or 2 (PD-L2); it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.","Autologous human T-lymphocytes that are genetically engineered to express a chimeric switch receptor (CSR) composed of the extracellular ligand binding domain of the human inhibitory receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1) fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic co-stimulatory signaling domains of CD28 (PD1CD28; PD-1:CD28 switch receptor), with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon reintroduction of autologous PD-1-targeted CSR-modified T-lymphocytes into the patient, the switch receptor expressed by the engineered T-cells targets and binds to the PD-1 ligands, programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2) expressed, on tumor cells. The nature of the PD-1/CD28 switch receptor fusion protein prevents the normal PD1/PD-L1-mediated T-cell suppression and, instead, promotes signaling through the CD28 domain, which results in the stimulation of T-lymphocytes. This induces enhanced toxicity against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. PD-1 protein, found on activated T-cells, negatively regulates T-cell activity; it plays a key role in immune evasion and prevents tumor cell lysis. Exchanging the transmembrane and intracellular domain of PD-1 with that of CD28 converts PD-L1 into a co-stimulation ligand of primary human CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). CD28, is a molecule expressed by T-cells that stimulates increased T-lymphocyte proliferation and activity.","An oncolytic vaccinia virus (VV; VACV) genetically engineered to express 4-E03, an immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody directed against the human inhibitory T-cell-expressed receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4;CTLA4) and the immunostimulatory cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), with potential oncolytic, immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities.

Tumor antigens released from the lysed tumor cells also activate the immune system to induce a tumor-specific systemic immune and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response, thereby killing nearby non-infected tumor cells. In addition, oncolytic virus BT-001 promotes the secretion of anti-CTLA-4 antibody 4-E03 and GM-CSF by the tumor cells. GM-CSF attracts dendritic cells (DCs) and may further stimulate a CTL-mediated immune response against tumor cells. Anti-CTLA-4 antibody 4-E03 targets and binds to CTLA-4 expressed on T-cells, and inhibits the CTLA-4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation. This enhances the CTL-mediated immune response against tumor cells. CTLA-4, an inhibitory receptor and member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), plays a key role in the downregulation of the immune system.","An autologous dendritic cell (DC) cancer vaccine with potential immunostimulatory activity. Anti-CTLA4 MoAb RNA/GITRL RNA-transfected DC vaccine is prepared by transfecting DCs with RNAs encoding humanized heavy and light chains of the anti-CTLA4 (cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Antigen 4) monoclonal antibody and tumor necrosis factor (ligand) superfamily, member 18 (TNFSF18 or GlTRL); expression of anti-CTLA4 blocks the inhibitory effect of CTLA4 on the activation of T-lymphocytes, while expression of GlTRL modulates T lymphocyte survival in peripheral tissues. Co-vaccination of this vaccine with melanoma antigen specific vaccine may eliminate the adverse effects associated with systemic administration of immune modulators, while also enhancing vaccine-induced immune responses.","A preparation of autologous T-lymphocytes that have been activated and genetically modified to express immune checkpoint antibodies against the negative immunoregulatory receptors human cell surface receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279) and human T-cell receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4; CTLA-4), and are transduced with a gene encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) specific for the human tumor-associated antigen (TAA) epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. After isolation, activation, transduction, expansion in culture and reintroduction into the patient, the T-cells in the autologous EGFR specific CAR-T-cells expressing anti-PD-1/CTLA4 antibodies  specifically target and kill EGFR-expressing tumor cells. The anti-PD-1 antibody secreted from the CAR-T cells binds to PD-1 expressed on T-cells and prevents the interaction of PD-1 with its ligand programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1, PD-1L1; CD274) expressed on cancer cells, which prevents PD-1-mediated signaling and T-cell exhaustion. The anti-CTLA4 expressed by the CAR-T cells targets and binds to CTLA4 expressed on T-cells, and inhibits the CTLA4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation. Both antibodies enhance T-cell activation, improve immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and improve the T-cell mediated immune response against and toxicity in EGFR-expressing tumor cells. Both PD-1 and CTLA-4 negatively regulate T-cell activation and proliferation, and play a key role in immunosuppression within the TME. EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is overexpressed in a variety of cancer cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation.","A preparation of autologous T-lymphocytes that have been activated and genetically modified to express immune checkpoint antibodies against the negative immunoregulatory receptors human cell surface receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279) and human T-cell receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4; CTLA-4), and are transduced with a gene encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) specific for the human tumor-associated antigen (TAA) epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities.

EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is overexpressed in a variety of cancer cell types, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation.","A preparation of autologous, engineered T-lymphocytes that express both a second-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) specific for the human gastric carcinoma-associated antigen MG7, and the co-stimulatory molecule 4-1BB (CD137), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon intratumoral injection, the autologous anti-MG7-CAR T-lymphocytes target and attach to cancer cells expressing MG7. This induces selective toxicity in and causes lysis of MG7-expressing tumor cells. MG7, a glycosylated protein sequence from the tumor-associated antigen (TAA) carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), plays a key role in the development of certain tumor cell types. 4-1BB enhances T-cell activation and signaling after recognition of MG7.","A preparation of autologous, engineered T-lymphocytes that express both a second-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) specific for the human gastric carcinoma-associated antigen MG7, and the co-stimulatory molecule 4-1BB (CD137), with potential antineoplastic activity.

MG7, a glycosylated protein sequence from the tumor-associated antigen (TAA) carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), plays a key role in the development of certain tumor cell types. 4-1BB enhances T-cell activation and signaling after recognition of MG7.","A genetically modified oncolytic viral strain of the herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) virus, expressing an antibody directed against the human inhibitory T-cell-expressed receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4;CTLA4), CD40 ligand (CD40L; CD154; TRAP; TNFSF5) and the co-stimulatory molecule tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily (TNFSF) member 9 (TNFSF9; 4-1BBL) with potential oncolytic, immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, the oncolytic HSV-1 expressing anti-CTLA-4 Antibody/CD40L/4-1BBL RP3 specifically infects and replicates in tumor cells causing viral-mediated tumor cell lysis. The released virus particles, in turn, infect and replicate in neighboring tumor cells. Tumor antigens released from the lysed tumor cells also activate the immune system to induce a tumor-specific systemic immune and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response, thereby killing nearby non-infected tumor cells. Oncolytic virus RP3 expresses a fusogenic protein, GALV-GP R-, for optimal tumor cell infection and killing. In addition, Oncolytic virus RP3 promotes the expression of anti-CTLA-4 antibody, CD40L and 4-1BBL by the tumor cells. Anti-CTLA-4 antibody targets and binds to CTLA-4 expressed on T-cells, and inhibits the CTLA-4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation. This leads to a CTL-mediated immune response against tumor cells. CTLA-4, an inhibitory receptor and member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), plays a key role in the downregulation of the immune system. CD40L specifically binds to and activates CD40, a cell surface receptor that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family and is expressed on various immune cells, such as B-lymphocytes, monocytes, and dendritic cells (DCs). Activation of CD40 induces proliferation and activation of B-lymphocytes, shifts the induction of suppressive macrophages towards immunostimulatory macrophages, activates monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs), and leads to the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, which activates the immune system to induce the proliferation and activation of CTLs against tumor cells. 4-1BBL binds to and subsequently induces the proliferation and activation of natural killer (NK) cells and T-cells. This enhances the secretion of cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-g) and further induces an anti-tumor immune response.","A 1:1 fixed dose combination formulation composed of the two monoclonal antibodies AI-025, a monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279), and gotistobart, a pH-sensitive immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody directed against the human T-cell-expressed receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4; CTLA-4; CD152), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration of anti-PD-1 antibody AI-025/anti-CTLA-4 antibody ONC-392 combination formulation AI-061, AI-025 targets, binds to and inhibits PD-1 and ONC-392 targets, binds to and inhibits CTLA-4. This inhibits the PD-1- and CTLA-4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation and proliferation. This restores immune function and activates a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against tumor cells. Both PD-1 and CTLA-4 are selectively expressed on TILs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and negatively regulate the activation and effector functions of T-cells. They play key roles in the downregulation of the immune system and tumor evasion from host immunity. Dual checkpoint blockade of PD-1 and CTLA-4 enhances T-cell activation and proliferation more than the blockade of either immune checkpoint receptor alone. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) expressed on T-cells, functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274) or 2 (PD-L2; CD273); it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity. CTLA-4, an inhibitory receptor and member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), plays a key role in the downregulation of the immune system.","A 1:1 fixed dose combination formulation composed of the two monoclonal antibodies AI-025, a monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279), and gotistobart, a pH-sensitive immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody directed against the human T-cell-expressed receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4; CTLA-4; CD152), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities.

CTLA-4, an inhibitory receptor and member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), plays a key role in the downregulation of the immune system.","A genetically engineered, ICP34.5- and ICP47-deleted oncolytic human herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), derived from the HG52 strain and encoding a bispecific antibody directed against the immunosuppressive ligand and immune checkpoint inhibitor programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274) and the T-cell surface antigen CD3, with potential oncolytic, immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, oncolytic HSV-2 expressing anti-PD-L1/CD3 bispecific antibody BS-006 selectively infects and replicates in tumor cells, thereby inducing tumor cell lysis. In addition, BS-006 promotes the secretion of anti-PD-L1/CD3 bispecific antibody by the infected tumor cells. The bispecific antibody targets and binds to both the CD3 on T-cells and the PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells. This results in the cross-linking of T-cells and tumor cells and may induce a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. At the same time, BS-006 prevents PD-L1 from binding to and activating its receptor, programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279; programmed death-1). This abrogates T-cell inhibition, activates antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhances CTL-mediated tumor cell lysis, which may further lead to a reduction in tumor growth. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on activated T-cells inhibits the expansion and survival of CD8-positive T-cells, suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion. Deletion of the gene encoding for ICP34.5 provides tumor selectivity and prevents replication in healthy cells. As ICP47 blocks antigen presentation in HSV-infected cells, deletion of this gene may induce a more potent antitumor immune response in the tumor cells. Deletion of ICP47 also leads to an increased expression of the HSV US11 gene and allows US11 to be expressed as an immediate early and not a late gene. This further enhances the degree of viral replication and the oncolysis of tumor cells.","A genetically modified oncolytic viral strain of the herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) virus, expressing the immunostimulatory cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and an antibody-like molecule directed against the human inhibitory T-cell-expressed receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4;CTLA4), with potential oncolytic, immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, the oncolytic HSV-1 expressing anti-CTLA-4 antibody-like molecule and GM-CSF RP2 specifically infects and replicates in tumor cells causing viral-mediated tumor cell lysis. The released virus particles, in turn, infect and replicate in neighboring tumor cells. Tumor antigens released from the lysed tumor cells also activate the immune system to induce a tumor-specific systemic immune and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response, thereby killing nearby non-infected tumor cells.

Pralatrexate selectively enters cells expressing RFC-1; intracellularly, this agent is highly polyglutamylated and competes for the folate binding site of DHFR, blocking tetrahydrofolate synthesis, which may result in depletion of nucleotide precursors; inhibition of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis; and apoptotic tumor cell death. Efficient intracellular polyglutamylation of pralatrexate results in higher intracellular concentrations compared to non-polyglutamylated pralatrexate, which is more readily effuxed by the MRP (multidrug resistance protein) drug efflux pump. RFC-1, an oncofetal protein expressed at highest levels during embryonic development, may be over-expressed on the cell surfaces of various cancer cell types.","A cytidine antimetabolite analogue with potential antineoplastic activity. Decitabine incorporates into DNA and inhibits DNA methyltransferase, resulting in hypomethylation of DNA and intra-S-phase arrest of DNA replication. (NCI04)","An arabinonucleoside antimetabolite with antineoplastic activity. Nelarabine is demethoxylated by adenosine deaminase to become biologically active 9-beta-D-arabinosylguanine (ara-G); ara-G incorporates into DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis and inducing an S phase-dependent apoptosis of tumor cells. (NCI04)","A synthetic pyrimidine-based antifolate. Pemetrexed binds to and inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase (TS), which catalyses the methylation of 2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (dUMP) to 2'-deoxythymidine-5'-monophosphate (dTMP), an essential precursor in DNA synthesis.","A pyrimidine nucleoside analogue of cytidine with antineoplastic activity. Azacitidine is incorporated into DNA, where it reversibly inhibits DNA methyltransferase, thereby blocking DNA methylation.  Hypomethylation of DNA by azacitidine may activate tumor suppressor genes silenced by hypermethylation, resulting in an antitumor effect. This agent is also incorporated into RNA, thereby disrupting normal RNA function and impairing tRNA cytosine-5-methyltransferase activity. (NCI04)","A second generation purine nucleoside analog with antineoplastic activity. Clofarabine is phosphorylated intracellularly to the cytotoxic active 5'-triphosphate metabolite, which inhibits the enzymatic activities of ribonucleotide reductase and DNA polymerase, resulting in inhibition of DNA repair and synthesis of DNA and RNA. This nucleoside analog also disrupts mitochondrial function and membrane integrity, resulting in the release of pre-apoptotic factors, including cytochrome C and apoptotic-inducing factors, which activate apoptosis.","A fluoropyrimidine carbamate belonging to the class of antineoplastic agents called antimetabolites.  As a prodrug, capecitabine is selectively activated by tumor cells to its cytotoxic moiety, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU); subsequently, 5-FU is metabolized to two active metabolites, 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP) by both tumor cells and normal cells.  FdUMP inhibits DNA synthesis and cell division by reducing normal thymidine production, while FUTP inhibits RNA and protein synthesis by competing with uridine triphosphate for incorporation into the RNA strand. (NCI04)","A broad-spectrum antimetabolite and deoxycytidine analogue with antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, gemcitabine is converted into the active metabolites difluorodeoxycytidine diphosphate (dFdCDP) and difluorodeoxycytidine triphosphate (dFdCTP) by deoxycytidine kinase. dFdCTP competes with deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) and is incorporated into DNA.  This locks DNA polymerase thereby resulting in \"masked termination\" during DNA replication. On the other hand, dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, thereby decreasing the deoxynucleotide pool available for DNA synthesis. The reduction in the intracellular concentration of dCTP potentiates the incorporation of dFdCTP into DNA.","A purine nucleoside antimetabolite analogue. Cladribine triphosphate, a phosphorylated metabolite of cladribine, incorporates into DNA, resulting in single-strand breaks in DNA, depletion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and apoptosis.  Because this agent is resistant to adenosine deaminase, an enzyme that inactivates some antineoplastic agents, it is selectively toxic to lymphocytes and monocytes which exhibit little deoxynucleotide deaminase activity. (NCI04)","A fluorinated pyrimidine monophosphate analogue of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-phosphate (FUDR-MP) with antineoplastic activity. As an antimetabolite, floxuridine inhibits thymidylate synthase, resulting in disruption of DNA synthesis and cytotoxicity. This agent is also metabolized to fluorouracil and other metabolites that can be incorporated into RNA and inhibit the utilization of preformed uracil in RNA synthesis. (NCI04)","An antimetabolite analogue of cytidine with a modified sugar moiety (arabinose instead of ribose). Cytarabine is converted to the triphosphate form within the cell and then competes with cytidine for incorporation into DNA.  Because the arabinose sugar sterically hinders the rotation of the molecule within DNA, DNA replication ceases, specifically during the S phase of the cell cycle.  This agent also inhibits DNA polymerase, resulting in a decrease in DNA replication and repair. (NCI04)","An antimetabolite fluoropyrimidine analog of the nucleoside pyrimidine with antineoplastic activity. Fluorouracil and its metabolites possess a number of different mechanisms of action. In vivo, fluoruracil is converted to the active metabolite 5-fluoroxyuridine monophosphate (F-UMP); replacing uracil, F-UMP incorporates into RNA and inhibits RNA processing, thereby inhibiting cell growth. Another active metabolite, 5-5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-O-monophosphate (F-dUMP), inhibits thymidylate synthase, resulting in the depletion of thymidine triphosphate (TTP), one of the four nucleotide triphosphates used in the in vivo synthesis of DNA. Other fluorouracil metabolites incorporate into both RNA and DNA; incorporation into RNA results in major effects on both RNA processing and functions.","A thiopurine-derivative antimetabolite with antineoplastic and immunosuppressive activities.  Produced through the metabolism of mercaptopurine by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), mercaptopurine metabolites 6-thioguanosine-5'-phosphate (6-thioGMP) and 6-thioinosine monophosphate (T-IMP) inhibit nucleotide interconversions and de novo purine synthesis, thereby blocking the formation of purine nucleotides and inhibiting DNA synthesis.  This agent is also incorporated into DNA in the form of deoxythioguanosine, which results in the disruption of DNA replication. In addition, mercaptopurine is converted to 6-methylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside (MMPR) by 6-thiopurine methyltransferase; MMPRs are also potent inhibitors of de novo purine synthesis. (NCI04)","A congener of the antimetabolite fluorouracil with antineoplastic activity. Tegafur is a prodrug that is gradually converted to fluorouracil in the liver by the cytochrome P-450 enzyme. Subsequently, 5-FU is metabolized to two active metabolites, 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP) by both tumor cells and normal cells.  FdUMP inhibits DNA synthesis and cell division by inhibiting thymidylate synthase and reducing normal thymidine production, while FUTP inhibits RNA and protein synthesis by competing with uridine triphosphate. (NCI04)","A quinazoline folate analogue with antineoplastic activity.  After transport into cells via the reduced folate carrier, raltitrexed undergoes intracellular polyglutamation and blocks the folate-binding site of thymidylate synthase, thereby inhibiting tetrahydrofolate activity and DNA replication and repair and resulting in cytotoxicity. (NCI04)","An orally bioavailable pyrimidine analogue prodrug with potential antineoplastic activity. Sapacitabine is hydrolyzed by amidases to the deoxycytosine analogue CNDAC (2'-Cyano-2'-deoxyarabinofuranosylcytosine), which is then phosphorylated into the active triphosphate form. As an analogue of deoxycytidine triphosphate, CNDAC triphosphate incorporates into DNA strands during replication, resulting in single-stranded DNA breaks during polymerization due to beta-elimination during the fidelity checkpoint process; cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase and apoptosis ensue. The unmetabolized prodrug may exhibit antineoplastic activity as well.","A pyrimidine analogue and a proprietary prodrug based on an aryloxy phosphoramidate derivative of gemcitabine with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon intravenous administration and cellular uptake, fosgemcitabine palabenamide is converted into the active metabolites difluorodeoxycytidine di- and triphosphate (dFdCDP, dFdCTP). dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, thereby decreasing the deoxynucleotide pool available for DNA replication; dFdCTP is incorporated into DNA, resulting in premature termination of DNA replication and eventually induction of apoptosis. With the phosphoramidate moiety on the gemcitabine monophosphate group, NUC-1031 has improved properties over its parent molecule: 1) is more lipophilic and accumulates in cancer cells by passive diffusion and does not require a nucleoside transporter, 2) as the agent is delivered in the monophosphate form, the first phosphorylation step by deoxycytidine kinase is not required, 3) this agent is not susceptible to deactivation by cytidine deaminase cleavage of the monophosphorylated form. Altogether, this may help overcome resistance to gemcitabine.","An antimetabolite and a chlorine derivative of the intracellular secondary messenger, cyclic adenosine 3,5-monophosphate (cAMP), with potential antineoplastic activity. Tocladesine appears to be converted to 8-chloro-adenosine by phosphodiesterases and subsequently phosphorylated to 8-chloro-ATP, which functions as a purine analogue and competes with ATP in transcription. In addition, generation of 8-chloro-ATP depletes endogenous ATP pool that is essential for many biological reactions in intracellular energy transfer. As a result, this agent causes RNA synthesis inhibition, blocks cellular proliferation, and induces apoptosis.","A synthetic pyrimidine nucleoside analogue with biomodulating activity. Tetrahydrouridine increases the efficacy of the radiosensitizer cytochlor (5-chloro-2'-deoxycytidine) by inhibiting the enzyme deoxycytidine monophosphate (dCMP) deaminase and preventing the premature deamination of the cytochlor metabolite 5-chloro-2'-deoxycytidine monophosphate (CldCMP) to 5-chloro-2'-deoxyuridine monophosphate (CldUMP); in turn, this increases tumor concentrations of CldUMP which is then further anabolized and incorporated selectively into tumor DNA as CldU (5-chloro-2'-deoxyuridine). (NCI04)","A phosphoramidate-based prodrug of the monophosphate (MP) form of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FUdR; FUDR), the active metabolite of fluorouracil (5-FU), an antimetabolite fluoropyrimidine analog of the pyrimidine nucleoside, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration of the nucleotide analog prodrug fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide, fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide is readily taken up by tumor cells. In the tumor cell, the phosphoramidate moiety is removed and fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide is converted to its active form FUDR-MP. In turn, FUDR-MP binds to and inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), resulting in the depletion of thymidine triphosphate (TTP) and thus DNA synthesis. With the phosphoramidate moiety attached to FUDR-MP, fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide, compared to 5-FU, is more lipophilic and accumulates in cancer cells by passive diffusion and does not require a nucleoside transporter, thereby generating higher intracellular concentrations. In addition, compared to 5-FU, once inside the cell FUDR-MP does not need to be phosphorylated and is already in its active form. Unlike 5-FU, fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide does not get deactivated or converted into toxic metabolites by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) and thymidine phosphorylase (TP), which leads to both a longer half-life and less toxicity.","An antimetabolite (pyrimidine analogue) antineoplastic derivative of 5-fluorouracil.

Cabazitaxel binds to and stabilizes tubulin, resulting in the inhibition of microtubule depolymerization and cell division, cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, and the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. Unlike other taxane compounds, this agent is a poor substrate for the membrane-associated, multidrug resistance (MDR), P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump and may be useful for treating multidrug-resistant tumors. In addition, cabazitaxel penetrates the blood-brain barrier (BBB).","A semi-synthetic, second-generation taxane derived from a compound found in the European yew tree, Taxus baccata.  Docetaxel displays potent and broad antineoplastic properties; it binds to and stabilizes tubulin, thereby inhibiting microtubule disassembly which results in cell- cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and cell death.  This agent also inhibits pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and displays immunomodulatory and pro-inflammatory properties by inducing various mediators of the inflammatory response.  Docetaxel has been studied for use as a radiation-sensitizing agent. (NCI04)","A compound extracted from the Pacific yew tree Taxus brevifolia with antineoplastic activity.  Paclitaxel binds to tubulin and inhibits the disassembly of microtubules, thereby resulting in the inhibition of cell division.  This agent also induces apoptosis by binding to and blocking the function of the apoptosis inhibitor protein Bcl-2 (B-cell Leukemia 2). (NCI04)","A semi-synthetic, orally bioavailable taxane derivative with potential antineoplastic and antiangiogenic properties. Tesetaxel binds to and stabilizes tubulin, promoting microtubule assembly and thereby preventing microtubule depolymerization. This may lead to cell cycle arrest and an inhibition of cell proliferation. This agent may also inhibit pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). As it represents poor substrate for P-glycoprotein-related drug resistance mechanisms, this agent may be useful for treating multi-drug resistant tumors.","NA","A semisynthetic, second-generation taxane derivative with potential antineoplastic activity. Ortataxel binds to and stabilizes tubulin molecules, thereby interfering with the dynamics of microtubule assembly/disassembly. This results in the inhibition of cell division and cellular proliferation. As it represents a poor substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multi-drug resistance protein (MRP-1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) mediated efflux, ortataxel modulates multi-drug resistance mechanisms and may be useful for treating multi-drug resistant tumors that express Pgp, MRP-1 and BCRP.","A semi-synthetic, orally bioavailable, third-generation taxane derivative and microtubule-stabilizing agent, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, simotaxel binds to tubulin, promotes microtubule assembly and stabilization, and prevents microtubule depolymerization. This results in G2/M arrest, apoptosis and the inhibition of cell proliferation in susceptible tumor cells. This agent is a poor substrate for P-glycoprotein-related drug resistance mechanisms; therefore, it may be useful for treating multi-drug resistant tumors. MST-997 is more potent than paclitaxel and docetaxel and overcomes paclitaxel and docetaxel resistance in certain tumor cell

A 'leaving group' is an atom or a group of atoms that is displaced as a stable species taking with it the bonding electrons. After displacement of the labile oxalate ligand leaving group, active oxaliplatin derivatives, such as monoaquo and diaquo DACH platinum, alkylate macromolecules, forming both inter- and intra-strand platinum-DNA crosslinks, which result in inhibition of DNA replication and transcription and cell-cycle nonspecific cytotoxicity. The DACH side chain appears to inhibit alkylating-agent resistance. (NCI04)","A second-generation platinum compound with a broad spectrum of antineoplastic properties.  Carboplatin contains a platinum atom complexed with two ammonia groups and a cyclobutane-dicarboxyl residue.  This agent is activated intracellularly to form reactive platinum complexes that bind to nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich sites in DNA, thereby inducing intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as DNA-protein cross-links.  These carboplatin-induced DNA and protein effects result in apoptosis and cell growth inhibition.  This agent possesses tumoricidal activity similar to that of its parent compound, cisplatin, but is more stable and less toxic. (NCI04)","NA","A third-generation, water-soluble platinum compound with potential antineoplastic activity. Lobaplatin forms highly reactive, charged, platinum complexes that bind to nucleophilic groups such as GC- and AG-rich sites in DNA, inducing intrastrand DNA cross-links. These cross-links will ultimately result in induction of apoptosis and cell growth inhibition. Compared to first and second generation platinum compounds, lobaplatin appears to be more stable, less toxic, have a better therapeutic index and may overcome tumor resistance.","NA","A new generation organic platinum analog with an extended spectrum of antineoplastic activity. Designed to overcome platinum drug resistance, picoplatin alkylates DNA, forming both inter- and intra-strand cross-linkages, resulting in inhibition of DNA replication and transcription, and the induction of apoptosis.","NA","NA","NA","A platinum (Pt)-based agent belonging to the phosphaplatin family comprised of Pt complexed to a pyrophosphate ligand, with potential antineoplastic activity. Although the exact mechanisms through which imifoplatin exerts its effect have yet to be fully elucidated, this agent, upon intravenous administration, binds to certain transmembrane proteins and activates several genes involved in tumor suppression and apoptosis. This leads to the activation of various signal transduction pathways, induces S/G2 phase cell cycle, and causes tumor cell apoptosis. In addition, imifoplatin may inhibit angiogenesis. Unlike conventional Pt-based chemotherapeutics, imifoplatin does not bind to DNA and is able to overcome drug resistance, which occurs with conventional Pt-based chemotherapeutics; it also has a more favorable side effect profile and is more stable in
