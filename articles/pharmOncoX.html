B-raf belongs to the raf/mil family of serine/threonine protein kinases and plays a role in regulating the MAP kinase/ERKs signaling pathway, which may be constitutively activated due to BRAF gene mutations.","The anhydrous form of regorafenib, an orally bioavailable small molecule with potential antiangiogenic and antineoplastic activities. Regorafenib binds to and inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) 2 and 3, and Ret, Kit, PDGFR and Raf kinases, which may result in the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. VEGFRs are receptor tyrosine kinases that play important roles in tumor angiogenesis; the receptor tyrosine kinases RET, KIT, and PDGFR, and the serine/threonine-specific Raf kinase are involved in tumor cell signaling.","An orally bioavailable, ATP-competitive, small-molecule inhibitor of BRAF(V600E) kinase with potential antineoplastic activity. Vemurafenib selectively binds to the ATP-binding site of BRAF(V600E) kinase and inhibits its activity, which may result in an inhibition of an over-activated MAPK signaling pathway downstream in BRAF(V600E) kinase-expressing tumor cells and a reduction in tumor cell proliferation. Approximately 90% of BRAF gene mutations involve a valine-to-glutamic acid mutation at residue 600 (V600E); the oncogene protein product, BRAF(V600E) kinase, exhibits a markedly elevated activity that over-activates the MAPK signaling pathway. The BRAF(V600E) gene mutation has been found to occur in approximately 60% of melanomas, and in about 8% of all solid tumors, including melanoma, colorectal, thyroid and other cancers.","A synthetic compound targeting growth signaling and angiogenesis. Sorafenib blocks the enzyme RAF kinase, a critical component of the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway that controls cell division and proliferation; in addition, sorafenib inhibits the VEGFR-2/PDGFR-beta signaling cascade, thereby blocking tumor angiogenesis.","An orally available inhibitor of all members of the serine/threonine protein kinase Raf family, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, naporafenib binds to Raf proteins and inhibits Raf-mediated signal transduction pathways. This inhibits proliferation of Raf-overexpressing tumor cells. Raf protein kinases are critical enzymes in the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway and are upregulated in a variety of cancer cell types. They play key roles in tumor cell proliferation and survival.","An orally available inhibitor of wild-type and certain mutant forms of A-Raf, B-Raf and C-Raf protein kinases, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, tovorafenib inhibits Raf-mediated signal transduction pathways, which may lead to an inhibition of tumor cell growth. Raf protein kinases play a key role in the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, which is often deregulated in human cancers and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and survival.","An orally available inhibitor of members of the Raf family of serine/threonine protein kinases, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, belvarafenib binds to and inhibits the B-Raf mutant V600E and C-Raf. This inhibits B-Raf V600E- and C-Raf-mediated signal transduction pathways, thereby inhibiting tumor cell growth of susceptible tumor cells. In addition, belvarafenib may also inhibit mutated Ras proteins. Raf protein kinases play a key role in the Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, which is often dysregulated in human cancers and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and survival. The Raf mutation B-Raf V600E, where the valine at residue 600 is substituted for glutamic acid, is frequently overexpressed in a variety of human tumors and results in the constitutive activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.","An orally active, small molecule with potential antineoplastic activity. XL281 specifically inhibits RAF kinases, located downstream from RAS in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK kinase signaling pathway, which may result in reduced proliferation of tumor cells. RAS mutations may result in constitutive activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK kinase signaling pathway, and have been found to occur frequently in human tumors.","NA","An orally bioavailable small molecule with potential antineoplastic activity. CHIR-265 binds and inhibits Raf kinases, which may result in a reduction of tumor cell growth and proliferation, and tumor cell death. In addition, this agent inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 2 (VEGFR-2), thereby disrupting tumor angiogenesis. Raf kinases are critical enzymes in the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway and are frequently upregulated in neoplasms.","An orally available v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (B-raf) serine/threonine protein kinase inhibitor with potential antineoplastic activity. Agerafenib specifically and selectively inhibits the activity of the mutated form (V600E) of B-raf kinase. This inhibits the activation of the RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) signaling pathway and may result in a decrease in the proliferation of tumor cells expressing the mutated B-raf gene. The Raf mutation BRAF V600E, in which valine is substituted for glutamic acid at residue 600, is frequently found in a variety of human tumors and results in the constitutive activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway that regulates cellular proliferation and survival.","An orally available inhibitor of all members of the serine/threonine protein kinase Raf family, including A-Raf, B-Raf and C-Raf protein kinases, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, pan-RAF kinase inhibitor LY3009120 inhibits Raf-mediated signal transduction pathways, which may inhibit tumor cell growth. Raf protein kinases play a key role in the RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, which is often dysregulated in human cancers and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and survival.","An inhibitor of the serine/threonine protein kinase B-raf (BRAF) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), with potential antineoplastic activity. Lifirafenib selectively binds to and inhibits the activity of BRAF and certain BRAF mutant forms, and EGFR. This prevents BRAF- and EGFR-mediated signaling and inhibits the proliferation of tumor cells that either contain a mutated BRAF gene or express over-activated EGFR. In addition, BGB-283 inhibits mutant forms of the Ras proteins K-RAS and N-RAS. BRAF and EGFR are mutated or upregulated in many tumor cell types.","An orally bioavailable inhibitor and specific dimer breaker of the serine/threonine-protein kinase B-raf (BRAF) protein, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, plixorafenib selectively binds to and inhibits the activity of dimeric BRAF mutants, including BRAF fusions and splice variants, and BRAFV600 monomers, while sparing RAF function in normal cells. This inhibits the proliferation of tumor cells which express these mutated forms of BRAF. BRAF, a member of the raf family of serine/threonine protein kinases, plays a role in the regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways, which may be constitutively activated due to BRAF gene mutations. Mutated forms and fusions of BRAF are associated with a number of neoplastic diseases."],[true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true],["by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp"],[true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],["FALSE","FALSE","TRUE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE"],["C98283","C82386","C78204","C64768","C61948","C125003","C106254","C121646","C69135","NA","C61311","C107245","C116861","C124995","C113330"],[1,0.842,0.944,1,0.85,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0.75,1,1],[false,false,false,false,true,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[14,19,36,21,100,2,5,3,4,1,2,1,4,1,8],[2018,2013,2012,2011,2005,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],[4,4,4,4,4,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],["cancer,

Upon administration of pacmilimab, the linkage system is stable in the circulation and, upon extravasation into the tumor microenvironment, the peptide mask is cleaved by tumor-associated proteases. These proteases are present in high concentrations and aberrantly activated in the tumor microenvironment, while expressed as inactive forms, at much lower concentrations, in normal, healthy tissue. Protease cleavage of the linker enables binding of the unmasked, fully active monoclonal antibody moiety of CX-072 to PD-L1, which is over expressed on certain cancer cells. This blocks the binding to and activation of its receptor programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) on T-lymphocytes, thereby enhancing the T-cell-mediated anti-tumor immune response and reversing PD-L1/PD-1-mediated T-cell suppression. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion. Compared to the unmodified PD-L1 antibody, peptide masking of CX-072 minimizes binding to PD-L1 in normal tissues, thereby decreasing autoimmune-based side effects while retaining anti-tumor activity.","NA","NA","An injectable formulation of a monoclonal antibody directed against programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274), with immune checkpoint inhibitory and potential antineoplastic activities.

Upon administration, avelumab binds to PD-L1 and prevents the interaction of PD-L1 with its receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). This inhibits the activation of PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore immune function through the activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) targeted to PD-L1-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, avelumab induces an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxic (ADCC) response against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. PD-1, a cell surface receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed on T-cells, negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligand, and plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity. PD-L1, a transmembrane protein, is overexpressed on a variety of tumor cell types and is associated with poor prognosis.","A humanized, Fc optimized, monoclonal antibody directed against the protein ligand PD-L1 (programmed cell death-1 ligand 1; CD274), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Atezolizumab binds to PD-L1, blocking its binding to and activation of its receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1; PDCD1) expressed on activated T-cells, which may enhance the T-cell-mediated immune response to neoplasms and reverse T-cell inactivation. In addition, by binding to PD-L1, atezolizumab also prevents binding of this ligand to B7.1 (CD80) expressed on activated T cells, which further enhances the T-cell-mediated immune response. PD-L1 is overexpressed on many human cancer cell types and on various tumor-infiltrating immune cells. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in increased immune evasion. PD-1, a transmembrane protein, is a negative regulator of the immune system that limits the expansion and survival of CD8+ T cells. The Fc region of atezolizumab is modified in such a way that it does not induce either antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).","A fully human immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell surface receptor programmed death-1 (PD-1, PCD-1) with immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, nivolumab binds to and blocks the activation of PD-1, an immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) transmembrane protein, by its ligands programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), which is overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), which is primarily expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This results in the activation of T-cells and cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and plays a key role in tumor evasion from host immunity.","A humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 antibody directed against human cell surface receptor PD-1 (programmed death-1 or programmed cell death-1) with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and plays a key role in in tumor evasion from host immunity.","A recombinant human monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell surface receptor programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; PD1), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, sintilimab binds to PD-1 and inhibits the binding of PD-1 to the PD-1 ligands programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), and PD-1 ligand 2 (PD-L2). This prevents the activation of PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore immune function through the activation of both T-cells and T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily expressed on activated T-cells, negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands; it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.","A human IgG2 monoclonal antibody directed against the T-cell receptor protein cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4). Tremelimumab binds to CTLA4 and blocks the binding of the antigen-presenting cell ligands B7-1 and B7-2 to CTLA4, resulting in inhibition of B7-CTLA4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation; subsequently, B7-1 or B7-2 may interact with another T-cell surface receptor protein, CD28, resulting in a B7-CD28-mediated T-cell activation unopposed by B7-CTLA4-mediated inhibition.","A humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell surface receptor programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; programmed death-1), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, dostarlimab binds to and inhibits PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore immune function through the activation of T-cells. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the Ig superfamily expressed on T-cells, functions as an immune checkpoint protein that negatively regulates T-cell activation and T-cell-mediated immune responses when activated by its ligands programmed cell death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1) or 2 (PD-L2); it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.","A monoclonal antibody directed against B7H1 (B7 homolog 1; programmed cell death ligand 1) with potential immunostimulating activity. Upon intravenous administration, durvalumab binds to the cell surface antigen B7H1, thereby blocking B7H1 signaling. This may activate the immune system to exert a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against B7H1-expressing tumor cells. B7H1, a member of the B7 protein superfamily and a negative regulator of cytokine synthesis, is overexpressed on certain tumor cell types.","A recombinant human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody directed against the human T-cell receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4), with immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Ipilimumab binds to CTLA4 expressed on T-cells and inhibits the CTLA4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation. This leads to a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against cancer cells. CTLA4, an inhibitory receptor and member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, plays a key role in the downregulation of the immune system.","NA","NA","NA","NA","An injectable formulation of a monoclonal antibody directed against programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274), with immune checkpoint inhibitory and potential antineoplastic activities. Upon subcutaneous administration, envafolimab binds to PD-L1, blocking its binding to and activation of its receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1), which may enhance the T-cell-mediated immune response to neoplasms and reverse T-cell inactivation. PD-L1 is overexpressed by many human cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion.

Pralatrexate selectively enters cells expressing RFC-1; intracellularly, this agent is highly polyglutamylated and competes for the folate binding site of DHFR, blocking tetrahydrofolate synthesis, which may result in depletion of nucleotide precursors; inhibition of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis; and apoptotic tumor cell death. Efficient intracellular polyglutamylation of pralatrexate results in higher intracellular concentrations compared to non-polyglutamylated pralatrexate, which is more readily effuxed by the MRP (multidrug resistance protein) drug efflux pump. RFC-1, an oncofetal protein expressed at highest levels during embryonic development, may be over-expressed on the cell surfaces of various cancer cell types.","A cytidine antimetabolite analogue with potential antineoplastic activity. Decitabine incorporates into DNA and inhibits DNA methyltransferase, resulting in hypomethylation of DNA and intra-S-phase arrest of DNA replication. (NCI04)","A synthetic pyrimidine-based antifolate. Pemetrexed binds to and inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase (TS), which catalyses the methylation of 2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (dUMP) to 2'-deoxythymidine-5'-monophosphate (dTMP), an essential precursor in DNA synthesis.","A pyrimidine nucleoside analogue of cytidine with antineoplastic activity. Azacitidine is incorporated into DNA, where it reversibly inhibits DNA methyltransferase, thereby blocking DNA methylation.  Hypomethylation of DNA by azacitidine may activate tumor suppressor genes silenced by hypermethylation, resulting in an antitumor effect. This agent is also incorporated into RNA, thereby disrupting normal RNA function and impairing tRNA cytosine-5-methyltransferase activity. (NCI04)","A second generation purine nucleoside analog with antineoplastic activity. Clofarabine is phosphorylated intracellularly to the cytotoxic active 5'-triphosphate metabolite, which inhibits the enzymatic activities of ribonucleotide reductase and DNA polymerase, resulting in inhibition of DNA repair and synthesis of DNA and RNA. This nucleoside analog also disrupts mitochondrial function and membrane integrity, resulting in the release of pre-apoptotic factors, including cytochrome C and apoptotic-inducing factors, which activate apoptosis.","A fluoropyrimidine carbamate belonging to the class of antineoplastic agents called antimetabolites.  As a prodrug, capecitabine is selectively activated by tumor cells to its cytotoxic moiety, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU); subsequently, 5-FU is metabolized to two active metabolites, 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP) by both tumor cells and normal cells.  FdUMP inhibits DNA synthesis and cell division by reducing normal thymidine production, while FUTP inhibits RNA and protein synthesis by competing with uridine triphosphate for incorporation into the RNA strand. (NCI04)","A broad-spectrum antimetabolite and deoxycytidine analogue with antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, gemcitabine is converted into the active metabolites difluorodeoxycytidine diphosphate (dFdCDP) and difluorodeoxycytidine triphosphate (dFdCTP) by deoxycytidine kinase. dFdCTP competes with deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) and is incorporated into DNA.  This locks DNA polymerase thereby resulting in \"masked termination\" during DNA replication. On the other hand, dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, thereby decreasing the deoxynucleotide pool available for DNA synthesis. The reduction in the intracellular concentration of dCTP potentiates the incorporation of dFdCTP into DNA.","A fluorinated pyrimidine monophosphate analogue of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-phosphate (FUDR-MP) with antineoplastic activity. As an antimetabolite, floxuridine inhibits thymidylate synthase, resulting in disruption of DNA synthesis and cytotoxicity. This agent is also metabolized to fluorouracil and other metabolites that can be incorporated into RNA and inhibit the utilization of preformed uracil in RNA synthesis. (NCI04)","An antimetabolite analogue of cytidine with a modified sugar moiety (arabinose instead of ribose). Cytarabine is converted to the triphosphate form within the cell and then competes with cytidine for incorporation into DNA.  Because the arabinose sugar sterically hinders the rotation of the molecule within DNA, DNA replication ceases, specifically during the S phase of the cell cycle.  This agent also inhibits DNA polymerase, resulting in a decrease in DNA replication and repair. (NCI04)","An antimetabolite fluoropyrimidine analog of the nucleoside pyrimidine with antineoplastic activity. Fluorouracil and its metabolites possess a number of different mechanisms of action. In vivo, fluoruracil is converted to the active metabolite 5-fluoroxyuridine monophosphate (F-UMP); replacing uracil, F-UMP incorporates into RNA and inhibits RNA processing, thereby inhibiting cell growth. Another active metabolite, 5-5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-O-monophosphate (F-dUMP), inhibits thymidylate synthase, resulting in the depletion of thymidine triphosphate (TTP), one of the four nucleotide triphosphates used in the in vivo synthesis of DNA. Other fluorouracil metabolites incorporate into both RNA and DNA; incorporation into RNA results in major effects on both RNA processing and functions.","An antimetabolite and antifolate agent with antineoplastic and immunosuppressant activities. Methotrexate binds to and inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, resulting in inhibition of purine nucleotide and thymidylate synthesis and, subsequently, inhibition of DNA and RNA syntheses. Methotrexate also exhibits potent immunosuppressant activity although the mechanism(s) of actions is unclear.","A thiopurine-derivative antimetabolite with antineoplastic and immunosuppressive activities.  Produced through the metabolism of mercaptopurine by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), mercaptopurine metabolites 6-thioguanosine-5'-phosphate (6-thioGMP) and 6-thioinosine monophosphate (T-IMP) inhibit nucleotide interconversions and de novo purine synthesis, thereby blocking the formation of purine nucleotides and inhibiting DNA synthesis.  This agent is also incorporated into DNA in the form of deoxythioguanosine, which results in the disruption of DNA replication. In addition, mercaptopurine is converted to 6-methylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside (MMPR) by 6-thiopurine methyltransferase; MMPRs are also potent inhibitors of de novo purine synthesis. (NCI04)","A congener of the antimetabolite fluorouracil with antineoplastic activity. Tegafur is a prodrug that is gradually converted to fluorouracil in the liver by the cytochrome P-450 enzyme. Subsequently, 5-FU is metabolized to two active metabolites, 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP) by both tumor cells and normal cells.  FdUMP inhibits DNA synthesis and cell division by inhibiting thymidylate synthase and reducing normal thymidine production, while FUTP inhibits RNA and protein synthesis by competing with uridine triphosphate. (NCI04)","A quinazoline folate analogue with antineoplastic activity.  After transport into cells via the reduced folate carrier, raltitrexed undergoes intracellular polyglutamation and blocks the folate-binding site of thymidylate synthase, thereby inhibiting tetrahydrofolate activity and DNA replication and repair and resulting in cytotoxicity. (NCI04)","An orally-active fluoropyrimidine analogue. Eniluracil inhibits dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme that catabolizes and inactivates 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in the liver. Co-administration of ethynyluracil permits the oral administration of 5-FU.","A synthetic pyrimidine nucleoside analogue with potential antineoplastic activity. Phosphorylated by cellular kinases, tezacitabine is converted into its active diphosphate and triphosphate metabolites. Tezacitabine diphosphate binds to and irreversibly inhibits the activity of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), which may result in the inhibition of DNA synthesis in tumor cells and tumor cell apoptosis. Tezacitabine triphosphate acts as a substrate for DNA polymerase, further compromising DNA replication. This agent is relatively resistant to metabolic deactivation by cytidine deaminase. RNR catalyzes the conversion of ribonucleoside 5'-diphosphates to deoxyribonucleoside 5'-diphosphates necessary for DNA synthesis and is overexpressed in many tumor types."],[true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true],["by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp"],[true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],["FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","TRUE","FALSE","TRUE","TRUE","FALSE","TRUE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE"],["C2250","C981","C61614","C288","C26638","C1794","C66876","C504","C408","C505","C642","C195","C513","C1804","C1773","C1539"],[1,0.793,0.886,0.806,0.8100000000000001,0.878,0.896,0.947,0.74,0.796,0.537,0.87,0.902,1,1,1],[false,true,false,true,false,false,false,false,true,true,true,false,false,false,false,false],[19,58,70,62,21,82,115,19,77,103,162,23,41,15,8,5],[2009,2006,2004,2004,2004,1998,1996,1970,1969,1962,1953,1953,null,null,null,null],[4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,2],["adult

Cabazitaxel binds to and stabilizes tubulin, resulting in the inhibition of microtubule depolymerization and cell division, cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, and the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. Unlike other taxane compounds, this agent is a poor substrate for the membrane-associated, multidrug resistance (MDR), P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump and may be useful for treating multidrug-resistant tumors. In addition, cabazitaxel penetrates the blood-brain barrier (BBB).","A semi-synthetic, second-generation taxane derived from a compound found in the European yew tree, Taxus baccata.  Docetaxel displays potent and broad antineoplastic properties; it binds to and stabilizes tubulin, thereby inhibiting microtubule disassembly which results in cell- cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and cell death.  This agent also inhibits pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and displays immunomodulatory and pro-inflammatory properties by inducing various mediators of the inflammatory response.  Docetaxel has been studied for use as a radiation-sensitizing agent. (NCI04)","A compound extracted from the Pacific yew tree Taxus brevifolia with antineoplastic activity.  Paclitaxel binds to tubulin and inhibits the disassembly of microtubules, thereby resulting in the inhibition of cell division.  This agent also induces apoptosis by binding to and blocking the function of the apoptosis inhibitor protein Bcl-2 (B-cell Leukemia 2). (NCI04)","A semi-synthetic derivative of the taxane 10-deacetylbaccatin III with potential antineoplastic activities. Larotaxel binds to tubulin, promoting microtubule assembly and stabilization and preventing microtubule depolymerization, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation. As it represents poor substrate for P-glycoprotein-related drug resistance mechanisms, this agent may be useful for treating multi-drug resistant tumors. Larotaxel penetrates the blood brain barrier.","NA","A prodrug comprised of the naturally occurring omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) covalently conjugated to the anti-microtubule agent paclitaxel.  Because tumor cells take up DHA, DHA-paclitaxel is delivered directly to tumor tissue, where the paclitaxel moiety binds to tubulin and inhibits the disassembly of microtubules, thereby resulting in the inhibition of cell division. Paclitaxel also induces apoptosis by binding to and blocking the function of the apoptosis inhibitor protein Bcl-2 (B-cell Leukemia 2).  DHA-paclitaxel exhibits improved pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles when compared to conventional paclitaxel and has demonstrated antineoplastic activity in animal models of cancer.
