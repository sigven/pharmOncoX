<p>Plotted below are key statistics with respect to drug classification
numbers for targeted and chemotherapy agents found in
<em>pharmOncoX</em>. Existing drug classifications have been retrieved
from <a href="https://www.whocc.no/" class="external-link">ATC</a>, and these have been
extended with manual addition/curation, and also through the
establishment of multiple novel levels in the ATC tree, particularly for
targeted therapies. Note that only drugs that are indicated for cancer
conditions (as harvested from the Open Targets platform) are considered
in the numbers plotted below.</p>

HLA-A1101-positive PBLs are harvested from a K-RAS G12D-expressing cancer patient and transfected with a retroviral vector that encodes anti-K-RAS G12D mTCR. The transduced PBLs are then expanded in culture. When reintroduced to the patient, these anti-K-RAS G12D mTCR-expressing PBLs target and bind to K-RAS G12D-overexpressing tumor cells, which results in both cytokine secretion, including interferon-gamma (IFN-g), and tumor cell lysis. K-RAS, a member of the RAS family of oncogenes, serves an important role in cell signaling, division and differentiation. Mutation of K-RAS may induce constitutive signal transduction leading to tumor cell growth, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis.","Autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) transduced with an HLA class I histocompatibility antigen A*11:01 (HLA-A1101)-restricted murine T-cell receptor (mTCR) that recognizes the glycine to valine point mutation at position 12 (G12V) variant of K-RAS, with potential antineoplastic activity.

This may activate antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhance cytotoxic T cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which leads to a reduction in tumor growth. LAG-3 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) and binds to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II. LAG-3 expression on TILs is associated with tumor-mediated immune suppression.","A humanized, pH-sensitive immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody directed against the human T-cell-expressed receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4; CTLA-4; CD152), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, gotistobart targets and binds to CTLA-4 expressed on T-cells and inhibits the CTLA-4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation. This leads to a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against cancer cells, thereby killing cancer cells. As gotistobart is dissociated from CTLA-4 under low pH, it does not cause lysosomal degradation of CTLA-4, preserving CTLA-4 and allowing the recycling of CTLA-4. This may result in more efficient and selective CTLA-4-targeted regulatory T-cell (Treg) depletion within the tumor microenvironment (TME) while preserving CTLA-4 functions outside the TME, thereby reducing toxicities. CTLA-4, an inhibitory receptor and member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), plays a key role in the downregulation of the immune system.","A monoclonal antibody directed against the inhibitory receptor lymphocyte activation gene-3 protein (LAG-3; LAG3; CD223), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities.

Upon administration of iparomlimab/tuvonralimab, iparomlimab and tuvonralimab target and bind to PD-1 and CTLA4 expressed on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), respectively. This inhibits the PD-1- and CTLA4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation and proliferation. This restores immune function and activates a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against tumor cells. Both PD-1 and CTLA4 are selectively expressed on TILs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and negatively regulate the activation and effector functions of T-cells. They play key roles in the downregulation of the immune system and tumor evasion from host immunity.

Upon administration of anti-CTLA-4 probody BMS-986288, the masking peptide is cleaved by tumor-associated proteases upon extravasation into the tumor microenvironment (TME). Protease-mediated removal of the linker enables binding of the unmasked monoclonal antibody moiety to CTLA-4, which is expressed on certain T-cells. This inhibits the CTLA4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation, and leads to both activation of tumor infiltrating T-effector cells and a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against cancer cells. CTLA4, an inhibitory receptor and member of the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed on activated effector T-cells (Teffs) and regulatory T-cells (Tregs), plays a key role in the inhibition of T-cell activity and downregulation of the immune system.

PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on activated T-cells inhibits the expansion and survival of CD8-positive T-cells, suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion. 4-1BB, a surface glycoprotein of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, is an inducible costimulatory receptor that plays a key role in T-cell proliferation, survival and cytolytic activity.","A bispecific antibody composed of a Fc-silenced human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody targeting human programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) fused with a single chain variable fragment (scFv) targeting 4-1BB (CD137; tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 9; TNFRSF9), with potential checkpoint inhibitory, immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, anti-PD-L1/anti-4-1BB bispecific antibody ABL503 simultaneously targets and binds to 4-1BB, which is expressed on a variety of leukocyte subsets including activated T-lymphocytes, and PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells. Upon PD-L1 binding, the 4-1BB activation signal is induced and ABL503 acts as a conditional 4-1BB agonist in the tumor microenvironment (TME), resulting in T-cell co-stimulation and enhances T-lymphocyte-mediated anti-tumor activity. At the same time, ABL503 prevents PD-L1 from binding to and activating its receptor, programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279; programmed death-1). This abrogates T-cell inhibition, activates antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which may lead to a reduction in tumor growth. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on activated T-cells inhibits the expansion and survival of CD8-positive T-cells, suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion. 4-1BB, a surface glycoprotein of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, is an inducible costimulatory receptor that plays a key role in T-cell proliferation, survival and cytolytic activity.","A fusion protein composed of a pentameric immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody directed against the immunosuppressive ligand programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274) fused to interleukin (IL)-15/IL-15 receptor alpha (IL-15Ra) complex, with potential immunostimulatory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration of the anti-PD-L1 antibody/IL-15 fusion protein IGM-7354, the anti-PD-L1 antibody moiety specifically targets and binds to PD-L1 expressing cancer cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME), thereby delivering IL-15 to PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. In turn, the IL-15 stimulates the proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) and memory T-cells locally, and reverses T-cell exhaustion. This induces an anti-tumor immune response in the TME against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. PD-L1, a transmembrane protein, is expressed on APCs and on various cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding to PD-1, a negative regulator of the immune system on activated T-cells, limits the expansion and survival of CD8-positive T-cells, suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion. The immunostimulatory cytokine IL-15 regulates CD8+ T- and NK cell development, activation, and proliferation. IL-15Ra complexed with IL-15 increases the half-life of IL-15. By binding to PD-L1-expressing cells in the TME, IGM-7354 enhances its IL-15-mediated activity on the immune system locally and increases its efficacy while reducing systemic toxicities.","A bispecific antibody targeting both the immunosuppressive ligand programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory, anti-angiogenic and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, anti-PD-L1/anti-VEGF-A bispecific antibody BNT327 targets and simultaneously binds to both PD-L1 and VEGF-A expressed on tumor cells. This prevents the binding of PD-L1 to its receptor, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279), inhibits the PD-1-mediated signaling, and inhibits the PD-1-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation and proliferation. This restores and enhances a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against tumor cells. The binding of BNT32 to VEGF-A prevents the binding of VEGF-A to VEGF receptor (VEGFR), thereby preventing the activation of VEGF-A/VEGFR-mediated signaling pathways. This prevents angiogenesis and may halt tumor cell proliferation. PD-L1 is overexpressed in many human cancer cell types and plays an important role in the downregulation of the immune system and tumor evasion from host immunity. VEGF-A is upregulated in a variety of cancer cell types and plays a crucial role in angiogenesis.","A fixed-dose co-formulation composed of pembrolizumab, a humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody directed against human cell surface receptor PD-1 (programmed death-1; programmed cell death-1; cluster of differentiation 279; CD279), and MK-5180, a recombinant form of human hyaluronidase, with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon subcutaneous administration of recombinant human hyaluronidase and pembrolizumab, the hyaluronidase reversibly depolymerizes the polysaccharide hyaluronan in the subcutaneous tissue. This increases the permeability of the subcutaneous tissue and enhances the absorption of pembrolizumab into the systemic circulation. In turn, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T-cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274), overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and plays a key role in in tumor evasion from host immunity. When administered subcutaneously, hyaluronidase, an endoglycosidase, increases the dispersion and absorption of co-administered drugs.","A bispecific antibody directed against the human negative immunoregulatory checkpoint receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PD1; PDCD1; CD279) and human transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) receptor II (TGFbRII), with potential immune checkpoint modulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, anti-PD-1/anti-TGFbRII bispecific antibody INCA33890 targets and binds to both PD-1 and TGFbRII and prevents the activation of PD-1 and TGF-beta-mediated signaling pathways in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The binding of INCA33890 to PD-1 prevents the activation of PD-1 by its ligands, programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; CD274) and/or 2 (PD-L2; CD273). This abrogates T-cell inhibition, activates antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated tumor cell lysis, which may lead to a reduction in tumor growth. The binding of INCA33890 to TGFbRII prevents the binding of TGF-beta to TGFbRII, thereby preventing the activation of the TGF-beta-mediated signaling pathway. This abrogates TGF-beta-mediated immunosuppression in the TME, increases natural killer (NK) cell and CTL activities, and inhibits tumor cell proliferation in susceptible tumor cells. PD-1, an inhibitory receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), is expressed on activated T-lymphocytes; it functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands and plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.

Upon administration, anti-PD-L1/VEGF/TGF-beta trispecific antibody DR30206 targets and simultaneously binds to both PD-L1 and VEGF expressed on tumor cells, and also neutralizes TGF-beta. This prevents both TGF-beta- and PD-L1-mediated immuno-suppressive pathways signaling, which increases natural killer (NK) cell and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activities, restores and enhances anti-tumor responses, and inhibits tumor cell proliferation in susceptible tumor cells. The binding of DR30206 to VEGF prevents the binding of VEGF to its receptor VEGFR, abrogates VEGF/VEGFR-mediated signaling and may lead to the inhibition of vascular endothelial cell proliferation. The inhibition of tumor angiogenesis may further decrease tumor cell proliferation and prevent metastasis. VEGF is overexpressed in a variety of cancers and is associated with increased invasiveness and decreased survival. TGF-beta and PD-L1 are both upregulated in certain types of cancers; their overexpression is associated with increased evasion of immune surveillance and contributes to poor prognosis.","A heterodimeric and bifunctional fusion protein composed of four chains: two heavy chains targeting the negative immunoregulatory human cell receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279), one of which is fused to the cytokine interleukin-15 (IL-15) while the other one is fused to IL-15 receptor alpha (IL15Ralpha; IL15Ra) sushi domain, which fuses the IL-15/IL-15Ra sushi domain complex, and two anti-PD1 antibody light chains, with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory, immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration of anti-PD-1 antibody-IL-15/IL-15Ra fusion protein IAP0971, the PD-1 targeting moiety specifically targets, binds to and inhibits PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore immune function through the activation of T-cells and induces a T-cell-mediated immune response against tumor cells. The IL-15 moiety specifically binds to the IL-2/15Rbeta,gamma receptor and activates IL-15-mediated signaling. This stimulates the proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) and memory T-cells locally in the in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and further induces an anti-tumor immune response. This may increase tumor cell killing and decrease tumor cell proliferation. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) expressed on T-cells, functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274) or 2 (PD-L2; CD273); it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity. IL-15 regulates CD8+ T and NK cell development, activation and proliferation. IL-15Ra complexed with IL-15 domain improves stability. IAP0971 increases specific signaling of IL-15 in the TME due to the high expression of PD-1 in the TME, thereby preventing systematic non-specific IL-15-mediated signaling.","A bispecific antibody fusion protein composed of a monoclonal antibody targeting the negative immunoregulatory human cell receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279) and fused to a mutated form of the endogenous cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2), with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, anti-PD-1/IL-2 bispecific antibody fusion protein IBI363 targets and binds to PD-1 expressed on PD-1-expressing T-cells, thereby inhibiting PD-1-mediated signaling. This may restore immune function through the activation of T-cells and T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. IL-2 targets and binds to the IL-2 receptor IL2R and activates IL-2/IL-2R-mediated signaling, which further activates cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells, and induces expression of certain cytotoxic cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFNg) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFb). This further enhances T-cell-mediated cytotoxic immune responses against tumor cells. By selectively activating PD-1 positive T-cells by IL-2, but not PD-1 negative bystander or na\u001a\u001ave T cells, the activity of tumor specific T-cells is specifically enhanced while IL-2-induced systemic toxicity is decreased. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) expressed on T-cells, functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274) or 2 (PD-L2); it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.","A bifunctional fusion protein targeting both the human negative immunoregulatory checkpoint receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279) and human transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta; TGFb), with potential immune checkpoint modulating, immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, anti-PD-1/TGF-beta RII bifunctional fusion protein JS201 targets and binds to PD-1 and TGF-beta and prevents the activation of PD-1 and TGF-beta-mediated signaling pathways in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This abrogates the PD-1- and TGFb-mediated immunosuppression in the TME, increases natural killer (NK) cell and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activities, and inhibits tumor cell proliferation in susceptible tumor cells. PD-1, an inhibitory receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), is expressed on activated T-lymphocytes; it functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands, and plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity. TGF-beta, a pro-inflammatory mediator, is upregulated in certain types of cancers and is involved in cancer cell proliferation, tumor progression and the suppression of the immune response.","A genetically modified oncolytic virus (OV) composed of a replication competent orthopoxviral chimera engineered to express the human sodium iodine symporter (hNIS) and a human monoclonal antibody directed against the immunosuppressive ligand and immune checkpoint inhibitor programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274), with potential oncolytic, immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities that can be used for radioimaging upon positron emission tomography (PET) and radiotherapeutic applications. Upon subcutaneous (SC) intratumoral (IT) administration of the oncolytic virus CF33-expressing hNIS/anti-PD-L1 antibody, the oncolytic virus specifically infects and replicates in tumor cells causing viral-mediated tumor cell lysis. The released virus particles, in turn, infect and replicate in neighboring tumor cells. Tumor antigens released from the lysed tumor cells also activate the immune system to induce a tumor-specific systemic immune and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response, thereby killing nearby non-infected tumor cells. In addition, the anti-PD-L1 antibody produced by the infected tumor cells targets and binds to PD-L1, blocking its binding to and activation of its receptor programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; cluster of differentiation 279; CD279), a transmembrane protein and negative regulator of the immune system, expressed on activated T-cells. This reverses T-cell inactivation caused by PD-1/PD-L1 signaling and enhances the CTL-mediated anti-tumor immune response against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells, thereby further killing tumor cells. Upon subsequent administration of certain iodine-containing imaging agents, hNIS expression by the infected tumor cells allows visualization and tracking of viral biodistribution, and analysis and quantification of CF33-infected tumor cells by PET. Also, administration of iodine I 131 results in its uptake by hNIS-expressing tumor cells, which may result in the selective accumulation of a cytotoxic dose of radiation in tumor cells while sparing adjacent normal tissue.","A bifunctional fusion protein directed against both the negative immunoregulatory human cell receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta; TGFb), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities.

Both PD-1 and CTLA-4 are selectively expressed on TILs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and negatively regulate the activation and effector functions of T-cells. They play key roles in the downregulation of the immune system and tumor evasion from host immunity. Dual checkpoint blockade of PD-1 and CTLA-4 enhances T-cell activation and proliferation more than the blockade of either immune checkpoint receptor alone.","A fixed dose combination of two monoclonal antibodies of which one is directed against the human negative immunoregulatory checkpoint receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279) and the other one is directed against the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4; CTLA-4), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities.

This prevents the binding of PD-L1 to its receptor, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1, CD279), inhibits the PD-1-mediated signaling, and inhibits the PD-1-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation and proliferation. This restores and enhances a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against VEGF-expressing tumor cells. The binding of B1962 to VEGF prevents the binding of VEGF to its receptor VEGFR, abrogates VEGF/VEGFR-mediated signaling and may lead to the inhibition of vascular endothelial cell proliferation. The inhibition of tumor angiogenesis may further decrease tumor cell proliferation and prevent metastasis. PD-L1 is overexpressed in many human cancer cell types and plays an important role in the downregulation of the immune system and tumor evasion from host immunity.

The released virus particles, in turn, infect and replicate in neighboring tumor cells. Tumor antigens released from the lysed tumor cells also activate the immune system to induce a tumor-specific systemic immune and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response, thereby killing nearby non-infected tumor cells. In addition, oHSV-1 expressing IL-12 and anti-PD-1 antibody T3011 promotes the secretion of IL-12 and anti-PD-1 antibody by the tumor cells. IL-12 promotes the activation of natural killer cells, which induces both the secretion of interferon-gamma and a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against the tumor cells. This results in both immune-mediated tumor cell death and further inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. Anti-PD-1 antibody targets, binds to and inhibits PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore immune function through the activation of T-cells and T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) expressed on T-cells, functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) or 2 (PD-L2); it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.","A recombinant fusion protein consisting of a human monoclonal antibody directed against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4; CTLA-4) fused to the immunostimulatory cytokine interleukin-15 (IL-15) cross-linked with the sushi domain of IL-15 receptor alpha (IL-15Ra), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration of anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody-IL-15/IL-15Ra fusion protein JK08, the monoclonal antibody domain targets and binds to CTLA-4 expressed on T-cells and inhibits the CTLA-4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation. The IL-15/IL-15Ra complex targets and binds to CD8+ T and natural killer (NK) cells, thereby increasing their activation and proliferation. Altogether, this leads to an inhibition of regulatory T-cell (Tregs)-mediated immunosuppression, induces antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), increases memory T-cells and enhances a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against cancer cells.

Upon intratumoral administration into the glioma, oHSV-1 expressing IL-12 and anti-PD-1 antibody MVR-C5252 specifically infects and replicates in glioma cells causing viral-mediated glioma cell lysis. The released virus particles, in turn, infect and replicate in neighboring glioma cells, thereby further killing tumor cells. Tumor antigens released from the lysed tumor cells also activate the immune system to induce a tumor-specific systemic immune and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response, thereby killing nearby non-infected glioma cells. In addition, as MVR-C5252 carries exogenous genes, it is also able to express IL-12 and anti-PD-1 antibody and are released by the infected cells, both of which are able to promote an immune response in the tumor microenvironment (TME). IL-12 promotes the activation of natural killer cells, which induces both the secretion of interferon-gamma and a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against uninfected glioma cells. This results in both immune-mediated tumor cell death and further inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. The anti-PD-1 antibody targets, binds to and inhibits PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore immune function through the activation of T-cells and T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells.

Upon reintroduction of autologous PD-1-targeted CSR-modified T-lymphocytes into the patient, the switch receptor expressed by the engineered T-cells targets and binds to the PD-1 ligands, programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2) expressed, on tumor cells. The nature of the PD-1/CD28 switch receptor fusion protein prevents the normal PD1/PD-L1-mediated T-cell suppression and, instead, promotes signaling through the CD28 domain, which results in the stimulation of T-lymphocytes. This induces enhanced toxicity against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. PD-1 protein, found on activated T-cells, negatively regulates T-cell activity; it plays a key role in immune evasion and prevents tumor cell lysis. Exchanging the transmembrane and intracellular domain of PD-1 with that of CD28 converts PD-L1 into a co-stimulation ligand of primary human CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). CD28, is a molecule expressed by T-cells that stimulates increased T-lymphocyte proliferation and activity.","An oncolytic vaccinia virus (VV; VACV) genetically engineered to express 4-E03, an immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody directed against the human inhibitory T-cell-expressed receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4;CTLA4) and the immunostimulatory cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), with potential oncolytic, immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities.

Anti-CTLA-4 antibody 4-E03 targets and binds to CTLA-4 expressed on T-cells, and inhibits the CTLA-4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation. This enhances the CTL-mediated immune response against tumor cells.

Upon intratumoral injection, the autologous anti-MG7-CAR T-lymphocytes target and attach to cancer cells expressing MG7. This induces selective toxicity in and causes lysis of MG7-expressing tumor cells. MG7, a glycosylated protein sequence from the tumor-associated antigen (TAA) carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), plays a key role in the development of certain tumor cell types. 4-1BB enhances T-cell activation and signaling after recognition of MG7.","A preparation of autologous, engineered T-lymphocytes that express both a second-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) specific for the human gastric carcinoma-associated antigen MG7, and the co-stimulatory molecule 4-1BB (CD137), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon intratumoral injection, the autologous anti-MG7-CAR T-lymphocytes target and attach to cancer cells expressing MG7. This induces selective toxicity in and causes lysis of MG7-expressing tumor cells. MG7, a glycosylated protein sequence from the tumor-associated antigen (TAA) carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), plays a key role in the development of certain tumor cell types. 4-1BB enhances T-cell activation and signaling after recognition of MG7.","A genetically modified oncolytic viral strain of the herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) virus, expressing an antibody directed against the human inhibitory T-cell-expressed receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4;CTLA4), CD40 ligand (CD40L; CD154; TRAP; TNFSF5) and the co-stimulatory molecule tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily (TNFSF) member 9 (TNFSF9; 4-1BBL) with potential oncolytic, immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, the oncolytic HSV-1 expressing anti-CTLA-4 Antibody/CD40L/4-1BBL RP3 specifically infects and replicates in tumor cells causing viral-mediated tumor cell lysis. The released virus particles, in turn, infect and replicate in neighboring tumor cells. Tumor antigens released from the lysed tumor cells also activate the immune system to induce a tumor-specific systemic immune and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response, thereby killing nearby non-infected tumor cells. Oncolytic virus RP3 expresses a fusogenic protein, GALV-GP R-, for optimal tumor cell infection and killing. In addition, Oncolytic virus RP3 promotes the expression of anti-CTLA-4 antibody, CD40L and 4-1BBL by the tumor cells. Anti-CTLA-4 antibody targets and binds to CTLA-4 expressed on T-cells, and inhibits the CTLA-4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation. This leads to a CTL-mediated immune response against tumor cells. CTLA-4, an inhibitory receptor and member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), plays a key role in the downregulation of the immune system. CD40L specifically binds to and activates CD40, a cell surface receptor that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family and is expressed on various immune cells, such as B-lymphocytes, monocytes, and dendritic cells (DCs). Activation of CD40 induces proliferation and activation of B-lymphocytes, shifts the induction of suppressive macrophages towards immunostimulatory macrophages, activates monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs), and leads to the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, which activates the immune system to induce the proliferation and activation of CTLs against tumor cells. 4-1BBL binds to and subsequently induces the proliferation and activation of natural killer (NK) cells and T-cells. This enhances the secretion of cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-g) and further induces an anti-tumor immune response.","A 1:1 fixed dose combination formulation composed of the two monoclonal antibodies AI-025, a monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279), and gotistobart, a pH-sensitive immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody directed against the human T-cell-expressed receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4; CTLA-4; CD152), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration of anti-PD-1 antibody AI-025/anti-CTLA-4 antibody ONC-392 combination formulation AI-061, AI-025 targets, binds to and inhibits PD-1 and ONC-392 targets, binds to and inhibits CTLA-4. This inhibits the PD-1- and CTLA-4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation and proliferation. This restores immune function and activates a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against tumor cells. Both PD-1 and CTLA-4 are selectively expressed on TILs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and negatively regulate the activation and effector functions of T-cells. They play key roles in the downregulation of the immune system and tumor evasion from host immunity. Dual checkpoint blockade of PD-1 and CTLA-4 enhances T-cell activation and proliferation more than the blockade of either immune checkpoint receptor alone. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) expressed on T-cells, functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274) or 2 (PD-L2; CD273); it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity. CTLA-4, an inhibitory receptor and member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), plays a key role in the downregulation of the immune system.","A 1:1 fixed dose combination formulation composed of the two monoclonal antibodies AI-025, a monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279), and gotistobart, a pH-sensitive immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody directed against the human T-cell-expressed receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4; CTLA-4; CD152), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities.

CTLA-4, an inhibitory receptor and member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), plays a key role in the downregulation of the immune system.","A genetically engineered, ICP34.5- and ICP47-deleted oncolytic human herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), derived from the HG52 strain and encoding a bispecific antibody directed against the immunosuppressive ligand and immune checkpoint inhibitor programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274) and the T-cell surface antigen CD3, with potential oncolytic, immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, oncolytic HSV-2 expressing anti-PD-L1/CD3 bispecific antibody BS-006 selectively infects and replicates in tumor cells, thereby inducing tumor cell lysis. In addition, BS-006 promotes the secretion of anti-PD-L1/CD3 bispecific antibody by the infected tumor cells. The bispecific antibody targets and binds to both the CD3 on T-cells and the PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells. This results in the cross-linking of T-cells and tumor cells and may induce a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. At the same time, BS-006 prevents PD-L1 from binding to and activating its receptor, programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279; programmed death-1). This abrogates T-cell inhibition, activates antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhances CTL-mediated tumor cell lysis, which may further lead to a reduction in tumor growth. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on activated T-cells inhibits the expansion and survival of CD8-positive T-cells, suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion. Deletion of the gene encoding for ICP34.5 provides tumor selectivity and prevents replication in healthy cells. As ICP47 blocks antigen presentation in HSV-infected cells, deletion of this gene may induce a more potent antitumor immune response in the tumor cells. Deletion of ICP47 also leads to an increased expression of the HSV US11 gene and allows US11 to be expressed as an immediate early and not a late gene. This further enhances the degree of viral replication and the oncolysis of tumor cells.","A genetically modified oncolytic viral strain of the herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) virus, expressing the immunostimulatory cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and an antibody-like molecule directed against the human inhibitory T-cell-expressed receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4;CTLA4), with potential oncolytic, immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, the oncolytic HSV-1 expressing anti-CTLA-4 antibody-like molecule and GM-CSF RP2 specifically infects and replicates in tumor cells causing viral-mediated tumor cell lysis. The released virus particles, in turn, infect and replicate in neighboring tumor cells. Tumor antigens released from the lysed tumor cells also activate the immune system to induce a tumor-specific systemic immune and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response, thereby killing nearby non-infected tumor cells.

Anti-CTLA-4 antibody-like molecule targets and binds to CTLA-4 expressed on T-cells, and inhibits the CTLA-4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation. This leads to a CTL-mediated immune response against tumor cells.

humanized, Fc optimized, monoclonal antibody directed against the protein ligand PD-L1 (programmed cell death-1 ligand 1; CD274), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Atezolizumab binds to PD-L1, blocking its binding to and activation of its receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1; PDCD1) expressed on activated T-cells, which may enhance the T-cell-mediated immune response to neoplasms and reverse T-cell inactivation. In addition, by binding to PD-L1, atezolizumab also prevents binding of this ligand to B7.1 (CD80) expressed on activated T cells, which further enhances the T-cell-mediated immune response. PD-L1 is overexpressed on many human cancer cell types and on various tumor-infiltrating immune cells. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in increased immune evasion. PD-1, a transmembrane protein, is a negative regulator of the immune system that limits the expansion and survival of CD8+ T cells. The Fc region of atezolizumab is modified in such a way that it does not induce either antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).","A human monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell surface receptor programmed cell death 1 (PD-1, PCD-1) protein, with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, cemiplimab binds to PD-1, inhibits its binding to the PD-1 ligand programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), and prevents the activation of its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore immune function through the activation of cytotoxic T-cells. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed on activated T-cells, negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligand; it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.","A humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 antibody directed against human cell surface receptor PD-1 (programmed death-1 or programmed cell death-1) with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and plays a key role in in tumor evasion from host immunity.","A recombinant human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody directed against the human T-cell receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4), with immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Ipilimumab binds to CTLA4 expressed on T-cells and inhibits the CTLA4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation. This leads to a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against cancer cells. CTLA4, an inhibitory receptor and member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, plays a key role in the downregulation of the immune system.","A proprietary humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell surface receptor programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, retifanlimab binds to and inhibits PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore immune function through the activation of T-cells and cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) expressed on T-cells, functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) or 2 (PD-L2); it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.","An immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), human monoclonal antibody directed against the immunosuppressive ligand programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, cosibelimab specifically targets and binds to PD-L1, blocking its binding to and activation of its receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279; programmed death-1). This reverses T-cell inactivation caused by PD-1/PD-L1 signaling and enhances the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated anti-tumor immune response against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. PD-L1 is overexpressed by many human cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion. PD-1, a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed on activated T-cells, is a negative regulator of the immune system that limits the expansion and survival of CD8-positive T-cells.","A humanized, pH-sensitive immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody directed against the human T-cell-expressed receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4; CTLA-4; CD152), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, gotistobart targets and binds to CTLA-4 expressed on T-cells and inhibits the CTLA-4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation. This leads to a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against cancer cells, thereby killing cancer cells. As gotistobart is dissociated from CTLA-4 under low pH, it does not cause lysosomal degradation of CTLA-4, preserving CTLA-4 and allowing the recycling of CTLA-4. This may result in more efficient and selective CTLA-4-targeted regulatory T-cell (Treg) depletion within the tumor microenvironment (TME) while preserving CTLA-4 functions outside the TME, thereby reducing toxicities. CTLA-4, an inhibitory receptor and member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), plays a key role in the downregulation of the immune system.","A human monoclonal antibody directed against the immunosuppressive ligand programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon intravenous administration, socazolimab specifically targets and binds to PD-L1, blocking its binding to and activation of its receptor programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; cluster of differentiation 279; CD279). This reverses T-cell inactivation caused by PD-1/PD-L1 signaling and enhances the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated anti-tumor immune response against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. PD-L1 is overexpressed by many human cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion. PD-1, a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) expressed on activated T-cells, is a negative regulator of the immune system that limits the expansion and survival of CD8-positive T-cells.","A human monoclonal antibody targeting the co-inhibitory molecule and immune checkpoint inhibitor T-cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin (Ig) and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) domains (TIGIT), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory activity. Upon administration, tiragolumab binds to TIGIT expressed on various immune cells, particularly on tumor-infiltrating T-lymphocytes (TILs), thereby preventing the interaction of TIGIT with its ligands CD112 (nectin-2; poliovirus receptor related-2; PVRL2) and CD155 (poliovirus receptor; PVR; nectin-like 5; NECL-5). This enhances the interaction of CD112 and CD155 with the costimulatory receptor CD226 (DNAX Accessory molecule-1; DNAM-1), which is expressed on immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T-cells, and leads to CD226 dimerization and CD226-mediated signaling. This activates the immune system to exert a T-cell-mediated immune response against cancer cells. TIGIT, a member of the Ig super family and immune inhibitory receptor, plays a key role in the suppression of T-cell proliferation and activation; it is involved in tumor cell immune evasion, and the inhibition of antiviral immune responses.","A humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody targeting the co-inhibitory molecule and immune checkpoint inhibitor T-cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin (Ig) and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) domains (TIGIT), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory activity. Upon administration, domvanalimab targets and binds to TIGIT expressed on various immune cells, particularly on tumor-infiltrating T-lymphocytes (TILs), thereby preventing the interaction of TIGIT with its ligands CD112 (nectin-2; poliovirus receptor related-2; PRR2; PVRL2) and CD155 (poliovirus receptor; PVR; nectin-like protein 5; NECL-5). This enhances the interaction of CD112 and CD155 with the costimulatory receptor CD226 (DNAX Accessory molecule-1; DNAM-1), which is expressed on immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T-cells. This leads to CD226 dimerization and CD226-mediated signaling and activates the immune system to exert a T-cell-mediated immune response against cancer cells. TIGIT, a member of the Ig super family (IgSF) and an immune inhibitory receptor, plays a key role in the suppression of T-cell proliferation and activation; it is involved in tumor cell immune evasion, and the inhibition of antiviral immune responses.","A bispecific monoclonal antibody directed against both the immunosuppressive ligand, programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274), and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4; CTLA-4), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, erfonrilimab targets and binds to both PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells and CTLA-4 expressed on T-cells.

immunity."],[true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true],["by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_target_nci","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_target_nci","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_target_nci","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_target_nci","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_target_nci","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_target_nci","by_cancer_target_nci","by_cancer_condition_otp"],[true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],["FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE"],["C106250","C121540","C106432","C2654","C142168","C151947","C173547","C162504","C131291","C162875","C157632","C157632","C140041","C159549","C103194","C68814","C49085","C116870","C155879","C132992","C148535","C170906","C156738","C154550","C121775","C123816","C111999","C126799","C176873","C132339","C153379","C153379","C129714","C157485","C160717","C131907","C126113","C121625","C131334","C142077","C150679","C159764","C129448","C124058","C136465","C137682","C132252","C176872","C161597","C158557","C148159"],[29126,5133,5133,1493,5133,29126,1493,29126,201633,201633,29126,1493,201633,5133,29126,5133,1493,29126,5133,5133,29126,201633,5133,29126,5133,5133,3902,5133,1493,3902,1493,5133,29126,5133,5133,201633,1493,5133,5133,3902,1493,1493,5133,5133,5133,5133,5133,201633,5133,1493,5133],["ENSG00000120217","ENSG00000188389","ENSG00000188389","ENSG00000163599","ENSG00000188389","ENSG00000120217","ENSG00000163599","ENSG00000120217","ENSG00000181847","ENSG00000181847","ENSG00000120217","ENSG00000163599","ENSG00000181847","ENSG00000188389","ENSG00000120217","ENSG00000188389","ENSG00000163599","ENSG00000120217","ENSG00000188389","ENSG00000188389","ENSG00000120217","ENSG00000181847","ENSG00000188389","ENSG00000120217","ENSG00000188389","ENSG00000188389","ENSG00000089692","ENSG00000188389","ENSG00000163599","ENSG00000089692","ENSG00000163599","ENSG00000188389","ENSG00000120217","ENSG00000188389","ENSG00000188389","ENSG00000181847","ENSG00000163599","ENSG00000188389","ENSG00000188389","ENSG00000089692","ENSG00000163599","ENSG00000163599","ENSG00000188389","ENSG00000188389","ENSG00000188389","ENSG00000188389","ENSG00000188389","ENSG00000181847","ENSG00000188389","ENSG00000163599","ENSG00000188389"],["single_protein","single_protein","single_protein","single_protein","single_protein","single_protein","single_protein","single_protein","single_protein","single_protein","single_protein","single_protein","single_protein","single_protein","single_protein","single_protein","single_protein","single_protein","single_protein","single_protein","single_protein","single_protein","single_protein","single_protein","single_protein","single_p

Pralatrexate selectively enters cells expressing RFC-1; intracellularly, this agent is highly polyglutamylated and competes for the folate binding site of DHFR, blocking tetrahydrofolate synthesis, which may result in depletion of nucleotide precursors; inhibition of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis; and apoptotic tumor cell death. Efficient intracellular polyglutamylation of pralatrexate results in higher intracellular concentrations compared to non-polyglutamylated pralatrexate, which is more readily effuxed by the MRP (multidrug resistance protein) drug efflux pump. RFC-1, an oncofetal protein expressed at highest levels during embryonic development, may be over-expressed on the cell surfaces of various cancer cell types.","The active l-isomer of the racemic mixture of the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid. Metabolically active, l-leucovorin, also known levoleucovorin, does not require bioactivation by dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme inhibited by folic acid antagonists. This agent may enhance the effects of fluoropyrimidines by stabilizing their binding to the enzyme thymidylate synthase. (NCI04)","A cytidine antimetabolite analogue with potential antineoplastic activity. Decitabine incorporates into DNA and inhibits DNA methyltransferase, resulting in hypomethylation of DNA and intra-S-phase arrest of DNA replication. (NCI04)","An arabinonucleoside antimetabolite with antineoplastic activity. Nelarabine is demethoxylated by adenosine deaminase to become biologically active 9-beta-D-arabinosylguanine (ara-G); ara-G incorporates into DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis and inducing an S phase-dependent apoptosis of tumor cells. (NCI04)","A synthetic pyrimidine-based antifolate. Pemetrexed binds to and inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase (TS), which catalyses the methylation of 2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (dUMP) to 2'-deoxythymidine-5'-monophosphate (dTMP), an essential precursor in DNA synthesis.","A pyrimidine nucleoside analogue of cytidine with antineoplastic activity. Azacitidine is incorporated into DNA, where it reversibly inhibits DNA methyltransferase, thereby blocking DNA methylation.  Hypomethylation of DNA by azacitidine may activate tumor suppressor genes silenced by hypermethylation, resulting in an antitumor effect. This agent is also incorporated into RNA, thereby disrupting normal RNA function and impairing tRNA cytosine-5-methyltransferase activity. (NCI04)","A second generation purine nucleoside analog with antineoplastic activity. Clofarabine is phosphorylated intracellularly to the cytotoxic active 5'-triphosphate metabolite, which inhibits the enzymatic activities of ribonucleotide reductase and DNA polymerase, resulting in inhibition of DNA repair and synthesis of DNA and RNA. This nucleoside analog also disrupts mitochondrial function and membrane integrity, resulting in the release of pre-apoptotic factors, including cytochrome C and apoptotic-inducing factors, which activate apoptosis.","A fluoropyrimidine carbamate belonging to the class of antineoplastic agents called antimetabolites.  As a prodrug, capecitabine is selectively activated by tumor cells to its cytotoxic moiety, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU); subsequently, 5-FU is metabolized to two active metabolites, 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP) by both tumor cells and normal cells.  FdUMP inhibits DNA synthesis and cell division by reducing normal thymidine production, while FUTP inhibits RNA and protein synthesis by competing with uridine triphosphate for incorporation into the RNA strand. (NCI04)","A broad-spectrum antimetabolite and deoxycytidine analogue with antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, gemcitabine is converted into the active metabolites difluorodeoxycytidine diphosphate (dFdCDP) and difluorodeoxycytidine triphosphate (dFdCTP) by deoxycytidine kinase. dFdCTP competes with deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) and is incorporated into DNA.  This locks DNA polymerase thereby resulting in \"masked termination\" during DNA replication. On the other hand, dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, thereby decreasing the deoxynucleotide pool available for DNA synthesis. The reduction in the intracellular concentration of dCTP potentiates the incorporation of dFdCTP into DNA.","A quinazoline folate analogue with antineoplastic activity.  After transport into cells via the reduced folate carrier, raltitrexed undergoes intracellular polyglutamation and blocks the folate-binding site of thymidylate synthase, thereby inhibiting tetrahydrofolate activity and DNA replication and repair and resulting in cytotoxicity. (NCI04)","A purine nucleoside antimetabolite analogue. Cladribine triphosphate, a phosphorylated metabolite of cladribine, incorporates into DNA, resulting in single-strand breaks in DNA, depletion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and apoptosis.  Because this agent is resistant to adenosine deaminase, an enzyme that inactivates some antineoplastic agents, it is selectively toxic to lymphocytes and monocytes which exhibit little deoxynucleotide deaminase activity. (NCI04)","A fluorinated pyrimidine monophosphate analogue of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-phosphate (FUDR-MP) with antineoplastic activity. As an antimetabolite, floxuridine inhibits thymidylate synthase, resulting in disruption of DNA synthesis and cytotoxicity. This agent is also metabolized to fluorouracil and other metabolites that can be incorporated into RNA and inhibit the utilization of preformed uracil in RNA synthesis. (NCI04)","An antimetabolite analogue of cytidine with a modified sugar moiety (arabinose instead of ribose). Cytarabine is converted to the triphosphate form within the cell and then competes with cytidine for incorporation into DNA.  Because the arabinose sugar sterically hinders the rotation of the molecule within DNA, DNA replication ceases, specifically during the S phase of the cell cycle.  This agent also inhibits DNA polymerase, resulting in a decrease in DNA replication and repair. (NCI04)","A monohydroxyl-substituted urea (hydroxycarbamate) antimetabolite. Hydroxyurea selectively inhibits ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase, an enzyme required to convert ribonucleoside diphosphates into deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates, thereby preventing cells from leaving the G1/S phase of the cell cycle.  This agent also exhibits radiosensitizing activity by maintaining cells in the radiation-sensitive G1 phase and interfering with DNA repair. (NCI04)","A synthetic guanosine analogue antimetabolite. Phosphorylated by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, thioguanine incorporates into DNA and RNA, resulting in inhibition of DNA and RNA syntheses and cell death. This agent also inhibits glutamine-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase, thereby inhibiting purine synthesis. (NCI04)","An antimetabolite fluoropyrimidine analog of the nucleoside pyrimidine with antineoplastic activity. Fluorouracil and its metabolites possess a number of different mechanisms of action. In vivo, fluoruracil is converted to the active metabolite 5-fluoroxyuridine monophosphate (F-UMP); replacing uracil, F-UMP incorporates into RNA and inhibits RNA processing, thereby inhibiting cell growth. Another active metabolite, 5-5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-O-monophosphate (F-dUMP), inhibits thymidylate synthase, resulting in the depletion of thymidine triphosphate (TTP), one of the four nucleotide triphosphates used in the in vivo synthesis of DNA. Other fluorouracil metabolites incorporate into both RNA and DNA; incorporation into RNA results in major effects on both RNA processing and functions.","An antimetabolite and antifolate agent with antineoplastic and immunosuppressant activities. Methotrexate binds to and inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, resulting in inhibition of purine nucleotide and thymidylate synthesis and, subsequently, inhibition of DNA and RNA syntheses. Methotrexate also exhibits potent immunosuppressant activity although the mechanism(s) of actions is unclear.","A thiopurine-derivative antimetabolite with antineoplastic and immunosuppressive activities.  Produced through the metabolism of mercaptopurine by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), mercaptopurine metabolites 6-thioguanosine-5'-phosphate (6-thioGMP) and 6-thioinosine monophosphate (T-IMP) inhibit nucleotide interconversions and de novo purine synthesis, thereby blocking the formation of purine nucleotides and inhibiting DNA synthesis.  This agent is also incorporated into DNA in the form of deoxythioguanosine, which results in the disruption of DNA replication. In addition, mercaptopurine is converted to 6-methylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside (MMPR) by 6-thiopurine methyltransferase; MMPRs are also potent inhibitors of de novo purine synthesis. (NCI04)","A derivative of folic acid with chemoprotectant, antidote and synergistic activity. Leucovorin does not require metabolism by dihydrofolate reductase, the molecular target of folate antagonist-type chemotherapeutic drugs, and is converted to a tetrahydrofolate, which is the necessary folate for purine and pyrimidine synthesis. As this agent allows for some purine/pyrimidine synthesis to occur, the toxic effects of folic acid antagonist-type chemotherapeutic drugs are counteracted while still permitting the antitumor activity of the folic acid antagonist through dihydrofolate reductase inhibition. This agent also potentiates the effects of 5-fluorouracil and its derivatives by stabilizing the binding of 5-fluorouracil's converted form fluorodeoxyuridylic acid to its target enzyme thymidylate synthase, thus prolonging drug activity.","A congener of the antimetabolite fluorouracil with antineoplastic activity. Tegafur is a prodrug that is gradually converted to fluorouracil in the liver by the cytochrome P-450 enzyme. Subsequently, 5-FU is metabolized to two active metabolites, 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP) by both tumor cells and normal cells.  FdUMP inhibits DNA synthesis and cell division by inhibiting thymidylate synthase and reducing normal thymidine production, while FUTP inhibits RNA and protein synthesis by competing with uridine triphosphate. (NCI04)","An orally-active fluoropyrimidine analogue. Eniluracil inhibits dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme that catabolizes and inactivates 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in the liver. Co-administration of ethynyluracil permits the oral administration of 5-FU.","An orally bioavailable pyrimidine analogue prodrug with potential antineoplastic activity. Sapacitabine is hydrolyzed by amidases to the deoxycytosine analogue CNDAC (2'-Cyano-2'-deoxyarabinofuranosylcytosine), which is then phosphorylated into the active triphosphate form. As an analogue of deoxycytidine triphosphate, CNDAC triphosphate incorporates into DNA strands during replication, resulting in single-stranded DNA breaks during polymerization due to beta-elimination during the fidelity checkpoint process; cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase and apoptosis ensue. The unmetabolized prodrug may exhibit antineoplastic activity as well.","A pyrimidine analogue and a proprietary prodrug based on an aryloxy phosphoramidate derivative of gemcitabine with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon intravenous administration and cellular uptake, fosgemcitabine palabenamide is converted into the active metabolites difluorodeoxycytidine di- and triphosphate (dFdCDP, dFdCTP). dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, thereby decreasing the deoxynucleotide pool available for DNA replication; dFdCTP is incorporated into DNA, resulting in premature termination of DNA replication and eventually induction of apoptosis. With the phosphoramidate moiety on the gemcitabine monophosphate group, NUC-1031 has improved properties over its parent molecule: 1) is more lipophilic and accumulates in cancer cells by passive diffusion and does not require a nucleoside transporter, 2) as the agent is delivered in the monophosphate form, the first phosphorylation step by deoxycytidine kinase is not required, 3) this agent is not susceptible to deactivation by cytidine deaminase cleavage of the monophosphorylated form. Altogether, this may help overcome resistance to gemcitabine.","An antimetabolite and a chlorine derivative of the intracellular secondary messenger, cyclic adenosine 3,5-monophosphate (cAMP), with potential antineoplastic activity. Tocladesine appears to be converted to 8-chloro-adenosine by phosphodiesterases and subsequently phosphorylated to 8-chloro-ATP, which functions as a purine analogue and competes with ATP in transcription. In addition, generation of 8-chloro-ATP depletes endogenous ATP pool that is essential for many biological reactions in intracellular energy transfer. As a result, this agent causes RNA synthesis inhibition, blocks cellular proliferation, and induces apoptosis.","A synthetic pyrimidine nucleoside analogue with potential antineoplastic activity. Phosphorylated by cellular kinases, tezacitabine is converted into its active diphosphate and triphosphate metabolites. Tezacitabine diphosphate binds to and irreversibly inhibits the activity of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), which may result in the inhibition of DNA synthesis in tumor cells and tumor cell apoptosis. Tezacitabine triphosphate acts as a substrate for DNA polymerase, further compromising DNA replication. This agent is relatively resistant to metabolic deactivation by cytidine deaminase. RNR catalyzes the conversion of ribonucleoside 5'-diphosphates to deoxyribonucleoside 5'-diphosphates necessary for DNA synthesis and is overexpressed in many tumor types.","A dioxolane derivative and a novel L-configuration deoxycytidine analogue with potent antineoplastic activity. When incorporated into growing chain during DNA replication, troxacitabine stops DNA polymerization due to its unnatural L-configuration, in contrast to the normal nucleotides with D-configuration. As a result, this agent terminates DNA synthesis upon incorporated into DNA molecules, and consequently interrupts tumor cell proliferation.","A small molecule pro-drug consisting of cytarabine, an antimetabolite analog of cytidine with a modified arabinose sugar moiety, covalently bonded to asparagine, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon intravenous administration, aspacytarabine targets cancer cells, which often lack asparagine synthetase and are dependent on an external source of amino acids due to their high metabolic rate. Once the prodrug is inside target cells, the cytarabine component is cleaved and competes with cytidine for incorporation into DNA. The arabinose sugar moiety of cytarabine sterically hinders the rotation of the molecule within DNA, resulting in cell cycle arrest, specifically during the S phase of replication. Cytarabine also inhibits DNA polymerase, resulting in a decrease in DNA replication and repair. Because BST-236 specifically targets cancer cells, it may spare normal tissues from cytarabine-related toxicities.","A synthetic pyrimidine nucleoside analogue with biomodulating activity. Tetrahydrouridine increases the efficacy of the radiosensitizer cytochlor (5-chloro-2'-deoxycytidine) by inhibiting the enzyme deoxycytidine monophosphate (dCMP) deaminase and preventing the premature deamination of the cytochlor metabolite 5-chloro-2'-deoxycytidine monophosphate (CldCMP) to 5-chloro-2'-deoxyuridine monophosphate (CldUMP); in turn, this increases tumor concentrations of CldUMP which is then further anabolized and incorporated selectively into tumor DNA as CldU (5-chloro-2'-deoxyuridine). (NCI04)","A thiopurine nucleoside derivative with antineoplastic activity. After conversion to the triphosphate, beta-thioguanine deoxyriboside is incorporated into DNA, resulting in inhibition of DNA replication.  This agent is cytotoxic against leukemia cell lines and has demonstrated some activity against leukemia cells in vivo.  Beta-thioguanine deoxyriboside demonstrates antineoplastic activity against 6-thioguanine-resistant tumor cells. (NCI04)","A liver-targeting nucleotide phosphoramidate prodrug of troxacitabine monophosphate (TRX-MP), a dioxolane derivative and L-configuration deoxycytidine analogue, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, fostroxacitabine bralpamide is rapidly and specifically hydrolyzed in hepatocytes by liver carboxylesterase 1 (carboxylesterase 1, CE-1), generating high levels of the chain-terminating nucleotide, troxacitabine triphosphate (TRX-TP) in the liver. TRX-TP is then incorporated into tumor cell DNA, leading to termination of DNA synthesis and inhibition of tumor cell proliferation.","A phosphoramidate-based prodrug of the monophosphate (MP) form of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FUdR; FUDR), the active metabolite of fluorouracil (5-FU), an antimetabolite fluoropyrimidine analog of the pyrimidine nucleoside, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration of the nucleotide analog prodrug fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide, fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide is readily taken up by tumor cells. In the tumor cell, the phosphoramidate moiety is removed and fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide is converted to its active form FUDR-MP. In turn, FUDR-MP binds to and inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), resulting in the depletion of thymidine triphosphate (TTP) and thus DNA synthesis. With the phosphoramidate moiety attached to FUDR-MP, fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide, compared to 5-FU, is more lipophilic and accumulates in cancer cells by passive diffusion and does not require a nucleoside transporter, thereby generating higher intracellular concentrations. In addition, compared to 5-FU, once inside the cell FUDR-MP does not need to be phosphorylated and is already in its active form. Unlike 5-FU, fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide does not get deactivated or converted into toxic metabolites by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) and thymidine phosphorylase (TP), which leads to both a longer half-life and less toxicity.","An antimetabolite (pyrimidine analogue) antineoplastic derivative of 5-fluorouracil. (NCI)","A fluorinated nucleotide antimetabolite analog of the antiviral agent vidarabine (ara-A) with antineoplastic activity. Administered parenterally as a phosphate salt, fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2-fluoro-ara-A and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2-fluoro-ara-ATP. This metabolite may inhibit DNA polymerase alpha, ribonucleotide reductase and DNA primase, thereby interrupting DNA synthesis and inhibiting tumor cell growth.  (NCI04)","A purine analogue with potential antineoplastic activity.  8-Azaguanine interferes with the modification of transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) by competing with guanine for incorporation into tRNA catalyzed by the enzyme tRNA-guanine ribosyltransferase (tRNA-guanine transglycosylase).  Altered guanine modification of tRNA has been implicated in cellular differentiation and neoplastic transformation.  8-Azaguanine also inhibits the formation of 43S and 80S initiation complexes, thereby interfering with initiation of translation and inhibiting protein synthesis.  This agent inhibits tumor cell growth and stimulates cell differentiation.

Cabazitaxel binds to and stabilizes tubulin, resulting in the inhibition of microtubule depolymerization and cell division, cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, and the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. Unlike other taxane compounds, this agent is a poor substrate for the membrane-associated, multidrug resistance (MDR), P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump and may be useful for treating multidrug-resistant tumors. In addition, cabazitaxel penetrates the blood-brain barrier (BBB).","A semi-synthetic, second-generation taxane derived from a compound found in the European yew tree, Taxus baccata.  Docetaxel displays potent and broad antineoplastic properties; it binds to and stabilizes tubulin, thereby inhibiting microtubule disassembly which results in cell- cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and cell death.  This agent also inhibits pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and displays immunomodulatory and pro-inflammatory properties by inducing various mediators of the inflammatory response.  Docetaxel has been studied for use as a radiation-sensitizing agent. (NCI04)","A compound extracted from the Pacific yew tree Taxus brevifolia with antineoplastic activity.  Paclitaxel binds to tubulin and inhibits the disassembly of microtubules, thereby resulting in the inhibition of cell division.  This agent also induces apoptosis by binding to and blocking the function of the apoptosis inhibitor protein Bcl-2 (B-cell Leukemia 2). (NCI04)","A semi-synthetic derivative of the taxane 10-deacetylbaccatin III with potential antineoplastic activities. Larotaxel binds to tubulin, promoting microtubule assembly and stabilization and preventing microtubule depolymerization, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation. As it represents poor substrate for P-glycoprotein-related drug resistance mechanisms, this agent may be useful for treating multi-drug resistant tumors. Larotaxel penetrates the blood brain barrier.","A semi-synthetic, orally bioavailable taxane derivative with potential antineoplastic and antiangiogenic properties. Tesetaxel binds to and stabilizes tubulin, promoting microtubule assembly and thereby preventing microtubule depolymerization. This may lead to cell cycle arrest and an inhibition of cell proliferation. This agent may also inhibit pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). As it represents poor substrate for P-glycoprotein-related drug resistance mechanisms, this agent may be useful for treating multi-drug resistant tumors.","The agent paclitaxel linked to a biodegradable, water-soluble polyglutamate polymer with antineoplastic properties. The polyglutamate residue increases the water solubility of paclitaxel and allows delivery of higher doses than those achievable with paclitaxel alone. Paclitaxel promotes microtubule assembly and prevents microtubule depolymerization, thus interfering with normal mitosis.","A prodrug comprised of the naturally occurring omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) covalently conjugated to the anti-microtubule agent paclitaxel.  Because tumor cells take up DHA, DHA-paclitaxel is delivered directly to tumor tissue, where the paclitaxel moiety binds to tubulin and inhibits the disassembly of microtubules, thereby resulting in the inhibition of cell division. Paclitaxel also induces apoptosis by binding to and blocking the function of the apoptosis inhibitor protein Bcl-2 (B-cell Leukemia 2).  DHA-paclitaxel exhibits improved pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles when compared to conventional paclitaxel and has demonstrated antineoplastic activity in animal models of cancer. (NCI04)","A semisynthetic, second-generation taxane derivative with potential antineoplastic activity. Ortataxel binds to and stabilizes tubulin molecules, thereby interfering with the dynamics of microtubule assembly/disassembly. This results in the inhibition of cell division and cellular proliferation. As it represents a poor substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multi-drug resistance protein (MRP-1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) mediated efflux, ortataxel modulates multi-drug resistance mechanisms and may be useful for treating multi-drug resistant tumors that express Pgp, MRP-1 and BCRP.","A semi-synthetic, orally bioavailable, third-generation taxane derivative and microtubule-stabilizing agent, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, simotaxel binds to tubulin, promotes microtubule assembly and stabilization, and prevents microtubule depolymerization. This results in G2/M arrest, apoptosis and the inhibition of cell proliferation in susceptible tumor cells. This agent is a poor substrate for P-glycoprotein-related drug resistance mechanisms; therefore, it may be useful for treating multi-drug resistant tumors. MST-997 is more potent than paclitaxel and docetaxel and overcomes paclitaxel and docetaxel resistance in certain tumor cell types.","The hemisuccinate form of docetaxel, a microtubule depolymerization inhibitor, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, sudocetaxel targets, binds to and stabilizes the beta-tubulin subunit of the microtubule, thereby inhibiting microtubule disassembly which results in cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and cell death."],[true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true],["by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp","by_cancer_condition_otp"],[true,true,true,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],["TRUE","TRUE","TRUE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE"],["C66937","C1526","C1411","C48427","C37451","C1795","C2649","C1867","C116871","C198974"],[0.92,0.879,0.797,1,1,0.929,1,1,1,1],[false,true,true,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[25,116,158,4,6,14,3,5,1,1],[2010,1996,1992,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],[4,4,4,3,3,3,3,2,1,1],["adrenal

A 'leaving group' is an atom or a group of atoms that is displaced as a stable species taking with it the bonding electrons. After displacement of the labile oxalate ligand leaving group, active oxaliplatin derivatives, such as monoaquo and diaquo DACH platinum, alkylate macromolecules, forming both inter- and intra-strand platinum-DNA crosslinks, which result in inhibition of DNA replication and transcription and cell-cycle nonspecific cytotoxicity. The DACH side chain appears to inhibit alkylating-agent resistance. (NCI04)","A second-generation platinum compound with a broad spectrum of antineoplastic properties.  Carboplatin contains a platinum atom complexed with two ammonia groups and a cyclobutane-dicarboxyl residue.  This agent is activated intracellularly to form reactive platinum complexes that bind to nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich sites in DNA, thereby inducing intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as DNA-protein cross-links.  These carboplatin-induced DNA and protein effects result in apoptosis and cell growth inhibition.  This agent possesses tumoricidal activity similar to that of its parent compound, cisplatin, but is more stable and less toxic. (NCI04)","An alkylating-like inorganic platinum agent (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum) with antineoplastic activity. Cisplatin forms highly reactive, charged, platinum complexes which bind to nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich sites in DNA inducing intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as DNA-protein cross-links. These cross-links result in apoptosis and cell growth inhibition.","A third-generation, water-soluble platinum compound with potential antineoplastic activity. Lobaplatin forms highly reactive, charged, platinum complexes that bind to nucleophilic groups such as GC- and AG-rich sites in DNA, inducing intrastrand DNA cross-links. These cross-links will ultimately result in induction of apoptosis and cell growth inhibition. Compared to first and second generation platinum compounds, lobaplatin appears to be more stable, less toxic, have a better therapeutic index and may overcome tumor resistance.","A second-generation cisplatin analogue with antineoplastic activity. Containing a novel ring structure in which glycolate is bound to the platinum by a bidentate ligand, nedaplatin forms reactive platinum complexes that bind to nucelophillic groups in DNA, resulting in intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, apoptosis and cell death. This agent appears to be less nephrotoxic and neurotoxic compared to both cisplatin and carboplatin.","A new generation organic platinum analog with an extended spectrum of antineoplastic activity. Designed to overcome platinum drug resistance, picoplatin alkylates DNA, forming both inter- and intra-strand cross-linkages, resulting in inhibition of DNA replication and transcription, and the induction of apoptosis.","An orally administered third generation platinum compound with potential antineoplastic activity. Satraplatin forms highly reactive, charged, platinum complexes which bind to nucleophilic groups in DNA, inducing intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as DNA-protein cross-links. These cross-links result in cell growth inhibition and apoptosis.","NA","A platinum (Pt)-based agent belonging to the phosphaplatin family comprised of Pt complexed to a pyrophosphate ligand, with potential antineoplastic activity. Although the exact mechanisms through which imifoplatin exerts its effect have yet to be fully elucidated, this agent, upon intravenous administration, binds to certain transmembrane proteins and activates several genes involved in tumor suppression and apoptosis. This leads to the activation of various signal transduction pathways, induces S/G2 phase cell cycle, and causes tumor cell apoptosis. In addition, imifoplatin may inhibit angiogenesis. Unlike conventional Pt-based chemotherapeutics, imifoplatin does not bind to DNA and is able to overcome drug resistance, which occurs with conventional Pt-based chemotherapeutics; it also has a more favorable side effect profile and is more stable in

The study found that in men with mCRPC who had somatic or germline deleterious alterations (irrespective of zygosity) in any of the following HRR genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, BRIP1, BARD1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, PPP2R2A, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, and RAD54L), olaparib was associated with longer progression-free survival and better measures of response and patient-reported end points than either enzalutamide or abiraterone (PFS HR 0.49 [0.38, 0.63]). For 15 patients with BRCA1 mutations specifically, PFS HR 0.41 [0.13-1.39]. . Based on the results of this study, on May 19, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration approved olaparib (LYNPARZA) for adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic HRR gene-mutated mCRPC, who have progressed following prior treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone.","In a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial, 553 patients with ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer with predominantly high-grade serous histologic features were enrolled.

After debulking surgery, the patient received standard‐of‐care treatment with radiation and temozolomide. Nine months later the PARP inhibitor olaparib was administered in combination with temozolomide for 16 cycles. This regimen was well tolerated by the patient and serial imaging showed a reduction in tumor size.",null,null,null,null,"The authors show that in the CX-5461 and CX-3543, G-quadruplex stabilizing agents, demonstrate specific toxicity against BRCA deficient breast cancer derived cells and polyclonal patient-derived xenograft models. Xenografts harbored both a germline BRCA and a somatic BRCA mutation leading to disruption of both. The BRCA and NHEJ pathways are required for the repair of CX-5461 and CX-3543-induced DNA damage and failure to do so leads to lethality.","In pancreatic cell lines PL11 (FANCC-deficient) and CAPAN1 (BRCA2-mutated), sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents was observed compared to FANCC/BRCA2 wildtype cell lines (Su86.86, CFPAC, AsPc1, and MiaPaCa2). Mitomycin C specifically led to regression in 8/11 xenografts of the CAPAN1 cell line compared to 2/9 in the CFPAC (BRCA2 wildtype) cell line.","The authors show that in the CX-5461 and CX-3543, G-quadruplex stabilizing agents, demonstrate specific toxicity against BRCA deficient breast cancer derived cells and polyclonal patient-derived xenograft models.
