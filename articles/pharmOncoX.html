Encorafenib specifically inhibits Raf kinase, a serine/threonine enzyme in the RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. By inhibiting the activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, the administration of LGX818 may result in a decrease in proliferation of tumor cells. The Raf mutation BRAF V600E is frequently upregulated in a variety of human tumors and results in the constitutive activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway that regulates cellular proliferation and survival.","An orally bioavailable inhibitor of B-raf (BRAF) protein with potential antineoplastic activity. Dabrafenib selectively binds to and inhibits the activity of B-raf, which may inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells which contain a mutated BRAF gene. B-raf belongs to the raf/mil family of serine/threonine protein kinases and plays a role in regulating the MAP kinase/ERKs signaling pathway, which may be constitutively activated due to BRAF gene mutations.","The anhydrous form of regorafenib, an orally bioavailable small molecule with potential antiangiogenic and antineoplastic activities. Regorafenib binds to and inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) 2 and 3, and Ret, Kit, PDGFR and Raf kinases, which may result in the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. VEGFRs are receptor tyrosine kinases that play important roles in tumor angiogenesis; the receptor tyrosine kinases RET, KIT, and PDGFR, and the serine/threonine-specific Raf kinase are involved in tumor cell signaling.","An orally bioavailable, ATP-competitive, small-molecule inhibitor of BRAF(V600E) kinase with potential antineoplastic activity. Vemurafenib selectively binds to the ATP-binding site of BRAF(V600E) kinase and inhibits its activity, which may result in an inhibition of an over-activated MAPK signaling pathway downstream in BRAF(V600E) kinase-expressing tumor cells and a reduction in tumor cell proliferation. Approximately 90% of BRAF gene mutations involve a valine-to-glutamic acid mutation at residue 600 (V600E); the oncogene protein product, BRAF(V600E) kinase, exhibits a markedly elevated activity that over-activates the MAPK signaling pathway. The BRAF(V600E) gene mutation has been found to occur in approximately 60% of melanomas, and in about 8% of all solid tumors, including melanoma, colorectal, thyroid and other cancers.","A synthetic compound targeting growth signaling and angiogenesis. Sorafenib blocks the enzyme RAF kinase, a critical component of the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway that controls cell division and proliferation; in addition, sorafenib inhibits the VEGFR-2/PDGFR-beta signaling cascade, thereby blocking tumor angiogenesis.","An orally available inhibitor of all members of the serine/threonine protein kinase Raf family, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, naporafenib binds to Raf proteins and inhibits Raf-mediated signal transduction pathways. This inhibits proliferation of Raf-overexpressing tumor cells. Raf protein kinases are critical enzymes in the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway and are upregulated in a variety of cancer cell types. They play key roles in tumor cell proliferation and survival.","An orally available inhibitor of members of the Raf family of serine/threonine protein kinases, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, belvarafenib binds to and inhibits the B-Raf mutant V600E and C-Raf. This inhibits B-Raf V600E- and C-Raf-mediated signal transduction pathways, thereby inhibiting tumor cell growth of susceptible tumor cells. In addition, belvarafenib may also inhibit mutated Ras proteins. Raf protein kinases play a key role in the Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, which is often dysregulated in human cancers and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and survival. The Raf mutation B-Raf V600E, where the valine at residue 600 is substituted for glutamic acid, is frequently overexpressed in a variety of human tumors and results in the constitutive activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.","NA","NA","An orally available v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (B-raf) serine/threonine protein kinase inhibitor with potential antineoplastic activity. Agerafenib specifically and selectively inhibits the activity of the mutated form (V600E) of B-raf kinase. This inhibits the activation of the RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) signaling pathway and may result in a decrease in the proliferation of tumor cells expressing the mutated B-raf gene. The Raf mutation BRAF V600E, in which valine is substituted for glutamic acid at residue 600, is frequently found in a variety of human tumors and results in the constitutive activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway that regulates cellular proliferation and survival.","An inhibitor of the serine/threonine protein kinase B-raf (BRAF) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), with potential antineoplastic activity. Lifirafenib selectively binds to and inhibits the activity of BRAF and certain BRAF mutant forms, and EGFR. This prevents BRAF- and EGFR-mediated signaling and inhibits the proliferation of tumor cells that either contain a mutated BRAF gene or express over-activated EGFR. In addition, BGB-283 inhibits mutant forms of the Ras proteins K-RAS and N-RAS. BRAF and EGFR are mutated or upregulated in many tumor cell types.","An orally available inhibitor of wild-type and certain mutant forms of A-Raf, B-Raf and C-Raf protein kinases, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, tovorafenib inhibits Raf-mediated signal transduction pathways, which may lead to an inhibition of tumor cell growth. Raf protein kinases play a key role in the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, which is often deregulated in human cancers and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and survival.","An orally active, small molecule with potential antineoplastic activity. XL281 specifically inhibits RAF kinases, located downstream from RAS in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK kinase signaling pathway, which may result in reduced proliferation of tumor cells. RAS mutations may result in constitutive activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK kinase signaling pathway, and have been found to occur frequently in human tumors.","An orally available inhibitor of all members of the serine/threonine protein kinase Raf family, including A-Raf, B-Raf and C-Raf protein kinases, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, pan-RAF kinase inhibitor LY3009120 inhibits Raf-mediated signal transduction pathways, which may inhibit tumor cell growth. Raf protein kinases play a key role in the RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, which is often dysregulated in human cancers and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and survival.","An orally bioavailable small molecule with potential antineoplastic activity. CHIR-265 binds and inhibits Raf kinases, which may result in a reduction of tumor cell growth and proliferation, and tumor cell death. In addition, this agent inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 2 (VEGFR-2), thereby disrupting tumor angiogenesis. Raf kinases are critical enzymes in the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway and are frequently upregulated in neoplasms."],[true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true],[true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],["FALSE","FALSE","TRUE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE"],["C98283","C82386","C78204","C64768","C61948","C125003","C121646","NA","NA","C107245","C124995","C106254","C69135","C116861","C61311"],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,true,false,true,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,true],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[null,null,null,"Kinase

Upon administration of pacmilimab, the linkage system is stable in the circulation and, upon extravasation into the tumor microenvironment, the peptide mask is cleaved by tumor-associated proteases. These proteases are present in high concentrations and aberrantly activated in the tumor microenvironment, while expressed as inactive forms, at much lower concentrations, in normal, healthy tissue. Protease cleavage of the linker enables binding of the unmasked, fully active monoclonal antibody moiety of CX-072 to PD-L1, which is over expressed on certain cancer cells.

PD-1, a transmembrane protein expressed on activated T-cells, is a negative regulator of the immune system that limits the expansion and survival of CD8+ T-cells.","An orally bioavailable inhibitor of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), with potential antineoplastic and immune checkpoint inhibitory activities. Upon administration, mavorixafor selectively binds to CXCR4 and prevents the binding of CXCR4 to its ligand, stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1 or CXCL12). This inhibits receptor activation and results in decreased proliferation and migration of CXCR4-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, inhibition of CXCR4 prevents the recruitment of regulatory T-cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to the tumor microenvironment, thereby abrogating CXCR4-mediated immunosuppression and enabling the activation of a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-mediated immune response against cancer cells. The G protein-coupled receptor CXCR4, which is upregulated in several tumor cell types, induces the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment, suppresses immune surveillance, and promotes tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. It is also a co-receptor for HIV entry into T-cells.","A humanized monoclonal antibody directed against human CD74 with potential antineoplastic activity. Milatuzumab specifically binds to CD74 on CD74-positive cells. Although the exact mechanism through which this agent induces apoptosis is unknown, it may involve antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC). Alternatively, as CD74 is the cellular receptor for the cytokine migration-inhibitory factor (MIF), the cytotoxicity of this agent may be related to inhibition of CD74 activation by MIF. CD74, an integral membrane protein that functions as an MHC class II chaperone, may also be an accessory-signaling molecule; activation of CD74 may initiate cell survival mechanisms involving induction of a signaling cascade resulting in NFkB activation, entry of stimulated cells into the S phase of the cell cycle, elevation of DNA synthesis, cell division, and augmented expression of Bcl-xL.","A small molecule immune checkpoint inhibitor of the adenosine A2A receptor (ADORA2A) with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, ciforadenant binds to adenosine A2A receptors expressed on the surface of immune cells, including T-lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs).

This enhances the interaction of CD112 and CD155 with the costimulatory receptor CD226 (DNAX Accessory molecule-1; DNAM-1), which is expressed on immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T-cells. This leads to CD226 dimerization and CD226-mediated signaling and activates the immune system to exert a T-cell-mediated immune response against cancer cells.

Upon administration,tinurilimab targets, binds to and blocks the activity of CEACAM6 expressed on various tumor and immune cells, including T-cells. Blocking CEACAM6 signaling abrogates effector T-cell inhibition, activates antigen-specific T-lymphocytes, increases secretion of T-cell cytokines and effector molecules, and enhances cytotoxic T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which results in a reduction in tumor cell proliferation. CEACAM6, an immune checkpoint receptor, is associated with tumor-mediated immune suppression. Elevated CEACAM6 expression is associated with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis.","A bispecific antibody directed against the human negative immunoregulatory checkpoint receptors programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PD1; PDCD1; CD279; Programmed Death 1) and lymphocyte activation gene 3 protein (LAG-3; LAG3; CD223), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, tobemstomig targets and binds to both PD-1 and LAG-3 expressed on T-cells and inhibits the PD-1- and LAG-3-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation and proliferation.

Upon administration, volrustomig targets and binds to both PD-1 and CTLA4 expressed on tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs), and inhibits the PD-1- and CTLA4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation and proliferation. In addition, volrustomig is internalized and is able to degrade PD-1. This restores immune function and activates a sustained cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against tumor cells. Both PD-1 and CTLA4 are selectively expressed on TILs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and negatively regulate the activation and effector functions of T-cells. They play key roles in the downregulation of the immune system and tumor evasion from host immunity. Dual checkpoint blockade of PD1 and CTLA4 with volrustomig may enhance T-cell activation and proliferation more than the blockade of either immune checkpoint receptor alone. It may also decrease toxicity by avoiding the binding to CTLA-4-expressing T-cells that are devoid of PD-1. The engineered Fc domain may reduce Fc effector function.","A human monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities.

This reverses T-cell inactivation caused by PD-1/PD-L1 signaling, leads to the co-stimulation of T-cell responses including the activation of na\u001a\u001ave and memory T-cells in the TME and enhances the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated anti-tumor immune response against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. In addition, davoceticept targets and binds to CTL-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4; CTLA-4) expressed on T-cells. This prevents the binding of CTLA-4 to endogenous CD80, thereby enabling CD80-CD28 engagement, CD28 signaling, and T-cell activation. This further promotes T-cell activity. PD-L1 is overexpressed by many human cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion. CD80 is a co-stimulatory molecule expressed on activated antigen presenting cells (APCs) that plays a key role in T-cell activation upon binding to CD28 on T-cells. On the other hand, binding of CD80 to CTLA-4 prevents CD80-CD28 engagement, thereby inhibiting T-cell activity and immune activation.

This induces pro-phagocytic signaling resulting from the binding of calreticulin (CRT), which is specifically expressed on the surface of tumor cells, to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1) expressed on macrophages, and results in macrophage activation and the specific phagocytosis of tumor cells. CD47, also called integrin-associated protein (IAP), is a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) expressed on normal, healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and overexpressed on the surface of a variety of cancer cells. Expression of CD47, and its interaction with SIRPa, leads to the inhibition of macrophage activation and protects tumor cells from phagocytosis, thereby allowing these cells to proliferate and survive.","A monoclonal antibody directed against the inhibitory receptor lymphocyte activation gene 3 protein (LAG3; LAG-3), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration,miptenalimab binds to LAG3 expressed on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and blocks its binding with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules expressed on tumor cells.

Betifisolimab contains a unique, not as of yet elucidated, pH-dependent antigen binding property allowing the antibody to only bind to PD-L1 within the acidic tumor microenvironment (TME), while it is not able to bind to PD-L1 in normal, healthy tissue. Upon administration, once able to bind to PD-L1 in the TME, betifisolimab blocks the binding of PD-L1 to and activation of its receptor, programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279; programmed death-1).

This prevents tumor-released adenosine from interacting with the A2A receptors, thereby blocking the adenosine/A2AR-mediated inhibition of T-lymphocytes. This results in the proliferation and activation of T-lymphocytes, and stimulates a T-cell-mediated immune response against tumor cells. A2AR, a G protein-coupled receptor, is highly expressed on the cell surfaces of T-cells and, upon activation by adenosine, inhibits their proliferation and activation.

Upon oral administration, the indoximod prodrug NLG802 is converted to indoximod. Indoximod targets, binds to and inhibits the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO; IDO1), which converts the essential amino acid tryptophan into the immunosuppressive metabolite kynurenine. By increasing tryptophan levels and decreasing kynurenine levels, indoximod restores and promotes the proliferation and activation of various immune cells, including dendritic cells (DCs), natural killer (NK) cells, and T-lymphocytes, and causes a reduction in tumor-associated regulatory T-cells (Tregs). Activation of the immune system, which is suppressed in many cancers, may induce a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against IDO1-expressing tumor cells, thereby inhibiting their growth. IDO1, overexpressed by multiple tumor cell types, plays an important role in immunosuppression. Tryptophan depletion inhibits T-lymphocyte proliferation and activation, and subsequently suppresses the immune system.

This prevents LAG-3-mediated signaling and LAG-3-mediated inhibition of the immune response. Together, blocking these two immune checkpoints re-activates the immune system, increases cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) proliferation and activation, and leads to a reduction in tumor growth. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and plays a key role in tumor evasion from host immunity.

Protease-mediated removal of the linker enables binding of the unmasked monoclonal antibody moiety to PD-1, thereby disrupting PD-1 signaling. This may restore immune function through the activation of T-cells and T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) expressed on T-cells, functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) or 2 (PD-L2); it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.

Upon administration of CD80-Fc fusion protein FPT155, the CD80 moiety targets and binds to CD28, which in the presence of antigenic T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling, leads to the co-stimulation of T-cell responses including the activation of na\u001a\u001ave and memory T-cells. This leads to a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against cancer cells, thereby killing cancer cells. FPT155 also targets and binds to CTL-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4; CTLA-4), preventing the binding of CTLA-4 to endogenous CD80, thereby enabling CD80-CD28 engagement, CD28 signaling, and T-cell activation in the tumor microenvironment. CD80 is a co-stimulatory molecule expressed on activated antigen presenting cells that plays a key role in T-cell activation upon binding to CD28 on T-cells. On the other hand, binding of CD80 to CTLA-4 prevents CD80-CD28 engagement, thereby inhibiting T-cell activity and immune activation.

Upon administration of anti-CTLA-4 probody BMS-986288, the masking peptide is cleaved by tumor-associated proteases upon extravasation into the tumor microenvironment (TME). Protease-mediated removal of the linker enables binding of the unmasked monoclonal antibody moiety to CTLA-4, which is expressed on certain T-cells. This inhibits the CTLA4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation, and leads to both activation of tumor infiltrating T-effector cells and a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against cancer cells.

This induces pro-phagocytic signaling mediated by the binding of calreticulin (CRT), which is specifically expressed on the surface of tumor cells, to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP), expressed on macrophages, which results in macrophage activation and the specific phagocytosis of the CD47-expressing tumor cells. The binding of HX009 to PD-1 blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD-1 ligand 2 (PD-L2).

The binding of NTX-1088 to CD226 prevents the internalization of CD226 and restores its expression on the surface of immune cells. This promotes CD226-dependent signaling pathways, which may trigger the activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and activate T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells, and result in an enhanced cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated and NK cell-mediated immune response against tumor cells. The binding of NTX-1088 to TIGIT expressed on various immune cells, particularly on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), prevents the interaction of TIGIT with its ligands and promotes the interaction of its ligands with the costimulatory receptor CD226 expressed on immune cells.

This results in the proliferation and activation of T-lymphocytes, and stimulates a T-cell-mediated immune response against tumor cells. A2AR, a G protein-coupled receptor, is highly expressed on the cell surfaces of T-cells and, upon activation by adenosine, inhibits their proliferation and activation.

Upon administration, anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody ONC-392 targets and binds to CTLA-4 expressed on T-cells and inhibits the CTLA-4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation. This leads to a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against cancer cells, thereby killing cancer cells. As ONC-392 is dissociated from CTLA-4 under low pH, it does not cause lysosomal degradation of CTLA-4, preserving CTLA-4 and allowing the recycling of CTLA-4. This may result in more efficient and selective CTLA-4-targeted regulatory T-cell (Treg) depletion within the tumor microenvironment (TME) while preserving CTLA-4 functions outside the TME, thereby reducing toxicities.

This enhances the interaction of CD112 and CD155 with the costimulatory receptor CD226 (DNAX Accessory molecule-1; DNAM-1), which is expressed on immune cells, such as NK cells and CD8+ T-cells. This leads to CD226 dimerization and CD226-mediated signaling and activates the immune system to exert a T-cell-mediated immune response against cancer cells. In addition, binding of AGEN1777 to the undisclosed target expressed on T-cells and NK cells may further enhance anti-tumor immune responses.

This induces pro-phagocytic signaling mediated by the binding of calreticulin (CRT), which is specifically expressed on the surface of tumor cells, to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1), which is expressed on macrophages, and results in macrophage activation and the specific phagocytosis of tumor cells. The binding of CD40L to CD40 activates CD40, increases CD40-mediated signaling and induces proliferation and activation of B-lymphocytes, shifts the induction of suppressive macrophages towards immunostimulatory macrophages, activates monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs), and leads to the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. This activates the immune system to induce the proliferation and activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) against tumor cells. The crosslinking specifically enhances antigen presentation to CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes and tumor cell phagocytosis by the APC. CD47, also called integrin-associated protein (IAP), is a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) expressed on normal, healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and overexpressed on the surface of a variety of cancer cells.

Upon administration of anti-PD-1/VEGF bispecific antibody AK112, this agent simultaneously targets and binds to both PD-1 expressed on certain T-cells and VEGF. The binding of AK112 to PD-1 prevents the activation of PD-1 by its ligands, programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and/or 2 (PD-L2).

Upon administration, anti-PD-L1/anti-OX40 bispecific antibody EMB-09 binds to PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells, and simultaneously binds to and activates OX40 on activated T-cells. The binding of EMB-09 to PD-L1 blocks its binding to and activation of its receptor, programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; cluster of differentiation 279; CD279). This reverses T-cell inactivation caused by PD-1/PD-L1 signaling and enhances the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated anti-tumor immune response against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. The binding of EMB-09 to OX40 and the activation of OX40 induces the proliferation of memory and effector T-lymphocytes, which also enhances the anti-tumor immune response against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells.

Usually, ligand binding to PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibits T-cell activity; however, these modified forms of PD-1 and CTLA-4 promote T-cell stimulatory signaling. Upon administration, the autologous PD-L1/CD80/CD86-targeted CAR-T cells target and bind to PD-L1 expressed on certain tumor cells and to CD80/CD86 expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This stimulates T-cell activation, T-cell proliferation and enhanced cytokine production, which induces selective toxicity in tumor cells expressing PD-L1. PD-1, found on activated T-cells, negatively regulates T-cell activity; it plays a key role in immune evasion and prevents tumor cell lysis. PD-L1 is often overexpressed on tumor cell types and plays a key role in immune evasion. The co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 play a key role in T-lymphocyte activation upon binding to CD28 upon antigen recognition; however, binding of CD80 and CD86 to wild-type CTLA-4 inhibits T-cell activity and results in T-cell exhaustion.","A humanized bispecific antibody targeting both the human cell surface antigen CD47 and the immunosuppressive ligand human programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274), with potential immunostimulating, phagocytosis-inducing and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, anti-CD47/anti-PD-L1 bispecific antibody 6MW3211 targets and binds to both CD47 and PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells. The CD47 binding by 6MW3211 blocks the interaction of CD47 with signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha), an inhibitory protein expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), which prevents CD47/SIRPalpha-mediated signaling and abrogates the CD47/SIRPalpha-mediated inhibition of phagocytosis.

This enhances the interaction of CD112 and CD155 with the costimulatory receptor CD226 (DNAX Accessory molecule-1; DNAM-1), which is expressed on immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T-cells. This leads to CD226 dimerization and CD226-mediated signaling and activates the immune system to exert a T-cell-mediated immune response against cancer cells. Inhibition of PD-L1 prevents its binding to and activation of its receptor, programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279; programmed death-1). This abrogates T-cell inhibition, activates antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which may lead to a reduction in tumor growth. TIGIT, a member of the Ig super family (IgSF) and an immune inhibitory receptor, plays a key role in the suppression of T-cell proliferation and activation; it is involved in tumor cell immune evasion, and the inhibition of antiviral immune responses. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on activated T-cells inhibits the expansion and survival of CD8-positive T-cells, suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion.","A co-formulation composed of atezolizumab, a humanized, Fc optimized, monoclonal antibody directed against the protein ligand PD-L1 (programmed cell death-1 ligand 1; CD274), and a recombinant form of human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon subcutaneous administration of atezolizumab and hyaluronidase, atezolizumab targets and binds to PD-L1, blocking its binding to and activation of its receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1; PDCD1) expressed on activated T-cells, which may enhance the T-cell-mediated immune response to neoplasms and reverse T-cell inactivation. In addition, by binding to PD-L1, atezolizumab also prevents binding of this ligand to B7.1 (CD80) expressed on activated T-cells, which further enhances the T-cell-mediated immune response. PD-L1 is overexpressed on many human cancer cell types and on various tumor-infiltrating immune cells. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in increased immune evasion. PD-1, a transmembrane protein, is a negative regulator of the immune system that limits the expansion and survival of CD8+ T-cells. The Fc region of atezolizumab is modified in such a way that it does not induce either antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Hyaluronidase hydrolyzes and degrades the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronic acid (HA), thereby decreasing interstitial viscosity and enhancing penetration of atezolizumab through the interstitial space. This facilitates the delivery of atezolizumab to PD-L1-expressing tumor cells.","A bispecific antibody directed against both the immunosuppressive ligand programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274) and the tumor-associated antigen (TAA) Claudin18.2 (CLDN18.2; A2 isoform of claudin-18), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory, immunostimulatory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, anti-PD-L1/Claudin18.2 bispecific antibody Q-1802 targets and simultaneously binds to both PD-L1 and CLDN18.2 expressed on certain types of tumor cells. This prevents the binding of PD-L1 to its receptor, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1, CD279), inhibits the PD-1-mediated signaling, and inhibits the PD-1-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation and proliferation. This restores and enhances a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against CLDN18.2-expressing tumor cells. PD-L1, which is overexpressed in many human cancer cell types, plays an important role in the downregulation of the immune system and tumor evasion from host immunity. CLDN18.2, a tight junction protein and stomach-specific isoform of claudin-18, is expressed on a variety of tumor cells, but its expression in healthy tissues is strictly confined to short-lived differentiated epithelial cells of the gastric mucosa.","A bispecific antibody directed against both the immunosuppressive ligand programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274) and the tumor-associated antigen (TAA) Claudin18.2 (CLDN18.2; A2 isoform of claudin-18), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory, immunostimulatory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, anti-PD-L1/Claudin18.2 bispecific antibody Q-1802 targets and simultaneously binds to both PD-L1 and CLDN18.2 expressed on certain types of tumor cells.

CLDN18.2, a tight junction protein and stomach-specific isoform of claudin-18, is expressed on a variety of tumor cells, but its expression in healthy tissues is strictly confined to short-lived differentiated epithelial cells of the gastric mucosa.","A bi-specific Fc fusion protein composed of the N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) of human CD80 (B7.1) fused to a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) Fc fragment and linked to an interleukin (IL)-2 variant (IL-2v) as a C-terminal moiety, with potential immunostimulatory, immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration of bispecific CD80-IgG4Fc-IL-2v fusion protein GI-101, the CD80 moiety targets and binds to CTL-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4; CTLA-4) expressed on T-cells. This prevents the binding of CTLA-4 to endogenous CD80, enables the binding of CD80 to CD28, which leads to CD28-mediated signaling, and results in the activation of T-cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This promotes T-cell activity. The IL-2 moiety may stimulate a local immune response and activate natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T-cells. This may enhance the activity of neoantigen specific T-cells and potentiates the T-cell-mediated immune response against tumor cells. CD80 is a co-stimulatory molecule expressed on activated antigen presenting cells (APCs) that plays a key role in T-cell activation upon binding to CD28 on T-cells. On the other hand, binding of CD80 to CTLA-4 prevents CD80-CD28 engagement, thereby inhibiting T-cell activity and immune activation. CTLA-4 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) and an inhibitory molecule upregulated by T-cells following T-cell activation. It plays a key role in the downregulation of the immune system. IL-2v cannot bind to IL-2 receptor-alpha (CD25, IL2Ra) and does not activate regulatory T-cells (Tregs).","A preparation of autologous T-lymphocytes that have been genetically engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) specific for the human tumor-associated antigen (TAA) CD22 and carrying a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of a monoclonal antibody targeting the immunosuppressive ligand programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274), with potential immunomodulatory and antineoplastic activities. Upon infusion, the autologous anti-PD-L1-armored anti-CD22 CAR T cells target and bind to CD22-expressing tumor cells, thereby inducing selective toxicity in CD22-expressing tumor cells. The scFv moiety binds to PD-L1, blocking the binding of PD-L1 to its receptor programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; cluster of differentiation 279; CD279), thereby preventing PD-1 activation on T-lymphocytes. This reverses T-cell inactivation caused by PD-1/PD-L1 signaling and enhances the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated anti-tumor immune response against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. PD-L1 is overexpressed by many human cancer cell types and plays a key role in the downregulation of the immune system and tumor evasion from host immunity. PD-1, found on activated T-cells, negatively regulates T-cell activity; it plays a key role in immune evasion and prevents tumor cell lysis. CD22, a cell surface glycoprotein, is expressed on mature B-cells and on most malignant B-cells.","A bispecific antibody targeting both the human cell surface antigen CD47 and the immunosuppressive ligand human programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274), with potential immunostimulating, phagocytosis-inducing and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, anti-CD47/anti-PD-L1 bispecific antibody PF-07257876 targets and binds to both CD47 and PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells. The CD47 binding by PF-07257876 blocks the interaction of CD47 with signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha), an inhibitory protein expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), which prevents CD47/SIRPalpha-mediated signaling and abrogates the CD47/SIRPalpha-mediated inhibition of phagocytosis. This induces pro-phagocytic signaling mediated by the binding of calreticulin (CRT), specifically expressed on the surface of tumor cells, to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP), expressed on macrophages, and results in macrophage activation and the specific phagocytosis of CD47-expressing tumor cells. The binding of PF-07257876 to PD-L1 blocks its binding to and activation of its receptor, programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; cluster of differentiation 279; CD279). This reverses T-cell inactivation caused by PD-1/PD-L1 signaling and enhances the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated anti-tumor immune response against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. CD47, also called integrin-associated protein (IAP), is a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) widely expressed on normal, healthy cells, such as red blood cells and platelets, and overexpressed on the surface of a variety of cancer cells. Expression of CD47, and its interaction with SIRPalpha, leads to the inhibition of macrophage activation, which protects cancer cells from phagocytosis and allows proliferation of cancer cells. PD-L1 is overexpressed by many human cancer cell types. PD-L1 binding to PD-1, a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) that is expressed on activated T-cells, suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion. By co-targeting CD47 and PD-L1, PF-07257876 may more selectively bind to tumor cells expressing both CD47 and PD-L1, reducing the side effects caused by the blockade of CD47 expressed on healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).","A bispecific antibody targeting both the human cell surface antigen CD47 and the immunosuppressive ligand human programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274), with potential immunostimulating, phagocytosis-inducing and antineoplastic activities.

Upon administration of PD-1 targeted IL-15 mutein fusion protein PF-07209960, the PD-1 targeting moiety specifically targets, binds to and inhibits PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore immune function through the activation of T-cells and T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The IL-15 mutein moiety binds to the IL-15 receptor and activates IL-15 cytokine signaling. This stimulates the proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) and memory T-cells locally in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and induces an anti-tumor immune response. This may increase tumor cell killing and decrease tumor cell proliferation. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) expressed on T-cells, functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1; cluster of differentiation 274; CD274) or 2 (PD-L2); it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity. IL-15 regulates CD8+ T and NK cell development, activation and proliferation.","A bispecific antibody fusion protein composed of a monoclonal antibody targeting the negative immunoregulatory human cell receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279) and fused to a mutated form of the endogenous cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2), with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, anti-PD-1/IL-2 bispecific antibody fusion protein IBI363 targets and binds to PD-1 expressed on PD-1-expressing T-cells, thereby inhibiting PD-1-mediated signaling. This may restore immune function through the activation of T-cells and T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. IL-2 targets and binds to the IL-2 receptor IL2R and activates IL-2/IL-2R-mediated signaling, which further activates cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells, and induces expression of certain cytotoxic cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFNg) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFb). This further enhances T-cell-mediated cytotoxic immune responses against tumor cells. By selectively activating PD-1 positive T-cells by IL-2, but not PD-1 negative bystander or na\u001a\u001ave T cells, the activity of tumor specific T-cells is specifically enhanced while IL-2-induced systemic toxicity is decreased.

Upon administration, anti-PD-1/TGF-beta RII bifunctional fusion protein JS201 targets and binds to PD-1 and TGF-beta and prevents the activation of PD-1 and TGF-beta-mediated signaling pathways in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This abrogates the PD-1- and TGFb-mediated immunosuppression in the TME, increases natural killer (NK) cell and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activities, and inhibits tumor cell proliferation in susceptible tumor cells. PD-1, an inhibitory receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), is expressed on activated T-lymphocytes; it functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands, and plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.

This also restores and enhances anti-tumor responses and inhibits tumor cell proliferation in susceptible tumor cells. TGF-beta and PD-L1 are both upregulated in certain types of cancers; their overexpression is associated with increased evasion of immune surveillance and contributes to poor prognosis.","A recombinant fusion protein comprised of an antibody directed against the human negative immunoregulatory checkpoint receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279) linked to an engineered, variant form of interleukin-2 (IL-2v), with potential immunostimulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration of PD-1-targeted IL-2v antibody fusion protein RO7284755, the antibody moiety specifically targets and binds to PD-1 expressed on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and inhibits the PD-1-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation and proliferation.

The nature of the PD-1/CD28 switch receptor fusion protein prevents the normal PD1/PD-L1-mediated T-cell suppression and, instead, promotes signaling through the CD28 domain, which results in the stimulation of T-lymphocytes. This induces enhanced toxicity against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. PD-1 protein, found on activated T-cells, negatively regulates T-cell activity; it plays a key role in immune evasion and prevents tumor cell lysis. Exchanging the transmembrane and intracellular domain of PD-1 with that of CD28 converts PD-L1 into a co-stimulation ligand of primary human CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). CD28, is a molecule expressed by T-cells that stimulates increased T-lymphocyte proliferation and activity.","A preparation of autologous T-lymphocytes that have been activated and genetically modified to express immune checkpoint antibodies against the negative immunoregulatory receptors human cell surface receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279) and human T-cell receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4; CTLA-4), and are transduced with a gene encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) specific for the human tumor-associated antigen (TAA) epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), with potential immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities.

Upon administration, dostarlimab binds to and inhibits PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore immune function through the activation of T-cells. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the Ig superfamily expressed on T-cells, functions as an immune checkpoint protein that negatively regulates T-cell activation and T-cell-mediated immune responses when activated by its ligands programmed cell death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1) or 2 (PD-L2); it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.","A human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody directed against the human immunosuppressive ligand programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein, with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, avelumab binds to PD-L1 and prevents the interaction of PD-L1 with its receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). This inhibits the activation of PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore immune function through the activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) targeted to PD-L1-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, avelumab induces an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxic (ADCC) response against PD-L1-expressing tumor cells. PD-1, a cell surface receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed on T-cells, negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligand, and plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity. PD-L1, a transmembrane protein, is overexpressed on a variety of tumor cell types and is associated with poor prognosis.","A monoclonal antibody directed against B7H1 (B7 homolog 1; programmed cell death ligand 1) with potential immunostimulating activity. Upon intravenous administration, durvalumab binds to the cell surface antigen B7H1, thereby blocking B7H1 signaling. This may activate the immune system to exert a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against B7H1-expressing tumor cells. B7H1, a member of the B7 protein superfamily and a negative regulator of cytokine synthesis, is overexpressed on certain tumor cell types.","A humanized, Fc optimized, monoclonal antibody directed against the protein ligand PD-L1 (programmed cell death-1 ligand 1; CD274), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Atezolizumab binds to PD-L1, blocking its binding to and activation of its receptor programmed death 1 (PD-1; PDCD1) expressed on activated T-cells, which may enhance the T-cell-mediated immune response to neoplasms and reverse T-cell inactivation. In addition, by binding to PD-L1, atezolizumab also prevents binding of this ligand to B7.1 (CD80) expressed on activated T cells, which further enhances the T-cell-mediated immune response. PD-L1 is overexpressed on many human cancer cell types and on various tumor-infiltrating immune cells. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in increased immune evasion. PD-1, a transmembrane protein, is a negative regulator of the immune system that limits the expansion and survival of CD8+ T cells. The Fc region of atezolizumab is modified in such a way that it does not induce either antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).","A fully human immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell surface receptor programmed death-1 (PD-1, PCD-1) with immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, nivolumab binds to and blocks the activation of PD-1, an immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) transmembrane protein, by its ligands programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), which is overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), which is primarily expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This results in the activation of T-cells and cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and plays a key role in tumor evasion from host immunity.","A humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 antibody directed against human cell surface receptor PD-1 (programmed death-1 or programmed cell death-1) with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands for PD-1 include programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), which is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and plays a key role in in tumor evasion from host immunity.","A recombinant human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody directed against the human T-cell receptor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4), with immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Ipilimumab binds to CTLA4 expressed on T-cells and inhibits the CTLA4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation. This leads to a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against cancer cells. CTLA4, an inhibitory receptor and member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, plays a key role in the downregulation of the immune system.","NA","A recombinant human monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell surface receptor programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; PD1), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, sintilimab binds to PD-1 and inhibits the binding of PD-1 to the PD-1 ligands programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), and PD-1 ligand 2 (PD-L2). This prevents the activation of PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore immune function through the activation of both T-cells and T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily expressed on activated T-cells, negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands; it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.","NA","NA","NA","A human IgG2 monoclonal antibody directed against the T-cell receptor protein cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4). Tremelimumab binds to CTLA4 and blocks the binding of the antigen-presenting cell ligands B7-1 and B7-2 to CTLA4, resulting in inhibition of B7-CTLA4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation; subsequently, B7-1 or B7-2 may interact with another T-cell surface receptor protein, CD28, resulting in a B7-CD28-mediated T-cell activation unopposed by B7-CTLA4-mediated inhibition.","A bifunctional fusion protein composed of an anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) human monoclonal antibody, bound to the soluble extracellular domain of human transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) receptor type II (TGFbetaRII), with potential antineoplastic and immune checkpoint modulating activities. Upon administration, bintrafusp alfa binds to and neutralizes activated TGFbeta and binds to PD-L1. This prevents TGFbeta- and PD-L1-mediated signaling, and increases natural killer (NK) cell and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activities. This inhibits tumor cell proliferation in susceptible tumor cells. TGFbeta and PD-L1 are both upregulated in certain types of cancers; their overexpression is associated with increased evasion of immune surveillance and contributes to poor prognosis.","A bifunctional fusion protein composed of an anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) human monoclonal antibody, bound to the soluble extracellular domain of human transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) receptor type II (TGFbetaRII), with potential antineoplastic and immune checkpoint modulating activities.

Anti-PD-1 fusion protein AMP-224 specifically binds to PD-1 on chronically stimulated T-cells and reduces their proliferation. This may restore immune function and may result in the activation of cytotoxic T-cells and cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. PD-1, a transmembrane protein of Ig superfamily and inhibitor receptor expressed on activated T-cells, negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands, and plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity. AMP-224 does not bind normal activated T-cells."],[true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true],[true,false,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,false,false,false,false,true,true],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],["FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE"],["C126799","C116870","C103194","C106250","C68814","C106432","C2654","NA","C132992","NA","NA","NA","C49085","C124229","C124229","C124229","C124229","NA","C97039"],[true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,false,false,false,false,true,true],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],[false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false],["Programmed

Upon oral administration, cedazuridine binds to and inhibits CDA, an enzyme primarily found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and liver that catalyzes the deamination of cytidine and cytidine analogs. Given in combination with a cytidine, such as the antineoplastic hypomethylating agent decitabine, it specifically prevents its breakdown and increases its bioavailability and efficacy. In addition, this allows for lower doses of decitabine to be administered, which results in decreased decitabine-associated GI toxicity.","A cytidine antimetabolite analogue with potential antineoplastic activity. Decitabine incorporates into DNA and inhibits DNA methyltransferase, resulting in hypomethylation of DNA and intra-S-phase arrest of DNA replication. (NCI04)","A pyrimidine nucleoside analogue of cytidine with antineoplastic activity. Azacitidine is incorporated into DNA, where it reversibly inhibits DNA methyltransferase, thereby blocking DNA methylation.  Hypomethylation of DNA by azacitidine may activate tumor suppressor genes silenced by hypermethylation, resulting in an antitumor effect. This agent is also incorporated into RNA, thereby disrupting normal RNA function and impairing tRNA cytosine-5-methyltransferase activity. (NCI04)","A second generation purine nucleoside analog with antineoplastic activity. Clofarabine is phosphorylated intracellularly to the cytotoxic active 5'-triphosphate metabolite, which inhibits the enzymatic activities of ribonucleotide reductase and DNA polymerase, resulting in inhibition of DNA repair and synthesis of DNA and RNA. This nucleoside analog also disrupts mitochondrial function and membrane integrity, resulting in the release of pre-apoptotic factors, including cytochrome C and apoptotic-inducing factors, which activate apoptosis.","A fluoropyrimidine carbamate belonging to the class of antineoplastic agents called antimetabolites.  As a prodrug, capecitabine is selectively activated by tumor cells to its cytotoxic moiety, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU); subsequently, 5-FU is metabolized to two active metabolites, 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP) by both tumor cells and normal cells.  FdUMP inhibits DNA synthesis and cell division by reducing normal thymidine production, while FUTP inhibits RNA and protein synthesis by competing with uridine triphosphate for incorporation into the RNA strand. (NCI04)","A broad-spectrum antimetabolite and deoxycytidine analogue with antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, gemcitabine is converted into the active metabolites difluorodeoxycytidine diphosphate (dFdCDP) and difluorodeoxycytidine triphosphate (dFdCTP) by deoxycytidine kinase. dFdCTP competes with deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) and is incorporated into DNA.  This locks DNA polymerase thereby resulting in \"masked termination\" during DNA replication. On the other hand, dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, thereby decreasing the deoxynucleotide pool available for DNA synthesis. The reduction in the intracellular concentration of dCTP potentiates the incorporation of dFdCTP into DNA.","A synthetic nucleoside analog of ribofuranose with activity against hepatitis C virus and other RNA viruses. Ribavirin is incorporated into viral RNA, thereby inhibiting viral RNA synthesis, inducing viral genome mutations, and inhibiting normal viral replication.","A fluorinated pyrimidine monophosphate analogue of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-phosphate (FUDR-MP) with antineoplastic activity. As an antimetabolite, floxuridine inhibits thymidylate synthase, resulting in disruption of DNA synthesis and cytotoxicity. This agent is also metabolized to fluorouracil and other metabolites that can be incorporated into RNA and inhibit the utilization of preformed uracil in RNA synthesis. (NCI04)","An antimetabolite analogue of cytidine with a modified sugar moiety (arabinose instead of ribose). Cytarabine is converted to the triphosphate form within the cell and then competes with cytidine for incorporation into DNA.  Because the arabinose sugar sterically hinders the rotation of the molecule within DNA, DNA replication ceases, specifically during the S phase of the cell cycle.  This agent also inhibits DNA polymerase, resulting in a decrease in DNA replication and repair. (NCI04)","A monohydroxyl-substituted urea (hydroxycarbamate) antimetabolite. Hydroxyurea selectively inhibits ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase, an enzyme required to convert ribonucleoside diphosphates into deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates, thereby preventing cells from leaving the G1/S phase of the cell cycle.  This agent also exhibits radiosensitizing activity by maintaining cells in the radiation-sensitive G1 phase and interfering with DNA repair. (NCI04)","A synthetic guanosine analogue antimetabolite. Phosphorylated by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, thioguanine incorporates into DNA and RNA, resulting in inhibition of DNA and RNA syntheses and cell death. This agent also inhibits glutamine-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase, thereby inhibiting purine synthesis. (NCI04)","An antimetabolite fluoropyrimidine analog of the nucleoside pyrimidine with antineoplastic activity. Fluorouracil and its metabolites possess a number of different mechanisms of action. In vivo, fluoruracil is converted to the active metabolite 5-fluoroxyuridine monophosphate (F-UMP); replacing uracil, F-UMP incorporates into RNA and inhibits RNA processing, thereby inhibiting cell growth. Another active metabolite, 5-5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-O-monophosphate (F-dUMP), inhibits thymidylate synthase, resulting in the depletion of thymidine triphosphate (TTP), one of the four nucleotide triphosphates used in the in vivo synthesis of DNA. Other fluorouracil metabolites incorporate into both RNA and DNA; incorporation into RNA results in major effects on both RNA processing and functions.","An antimetabolite and antifolate agent with antineoplastic and immunosuppressant activities. Methotrexate binds to and inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, resulting in inhibition of purine nucleotide and thymidylate synthesis and, subsequently, inhibition of DNA and RNA syntheses. Methotrexate also exhibits potent immunosuppressant activity although the mechanism(s) of actions is unclear.","A thiopurine-derivative antimetabolite with antineoplastic and immunosuppressive activities.  Produced through the metabolism of mercaptopurine by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), mercaptopurine metabolites 6-thioguanosine-5'-phosphate (6-thioGMP) and 6-thioinosine monophosphate (T-IMP) inhibit nucleotide interconversions and de novo purine synthesis, thereby blocking the formation of purine nucleotides and inhibiting DNA synthesis.  This agent is also incorporated into DNA in the form of deoxythioguanosine, which results in the disruption of DNA replication. In addition, mercaptopurine is converted to 6-methylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside (MMPR) by 6-thiopurine methyltransferase; MMPRs are also potent inhibitors of de novo purine synthesis. (NCI04)","A congener of the antimetabolite fluorouracil with antineoplastic activity. Tegafur is a prodrug that is gradually converted to fluorouracil in the liver by the cytochrome P-450 enzyme. Subsequently, 5-FU is metabolized to two active metabolites, 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP) by both tumor cells and normal cells.  FdUMP inhibits DNA synthesis and cell division by inhibiting thymidylate synthase and reducing normal thymidine production, while FUTP inhibits RNA and protein synthesis by competing with uridine triphosphate. (NCI04)","The R-isomer of folitixorin, a reduced folate-based biomodulator and active metabolite of folate drugs leucovorin (LV) and levoleucovorin (l-LV) that can be used to increase the efficacy of certain antimetabolites, such as the cytotoxic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and reduce as well as protect against certain antimetabolite-associated adverse effects, such as those seen with high-dose (HD) methotrexate. Upon administration of arfolitixorin, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (MTHF) is a reduced folate substrate for the enzyme thymidylate synthase (TS) and stabilizes, upon co-administration of 5-FU, the covalent binding of the 5-FU metabolite 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (FdUMP), instead of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP), to its target enzyme TS, which results in an inhibition of TS. This inhibits the synthesis of deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) and leads to the depletion of thymidine triphosphate (TTP), which is a necessary constituent of DNA. This inhibits DNA synthesis, which leads to an inhibition of cellular proliferation and induces tumor cell death. As MTHF is able to stabilize and strengthen the ternary complex, co-administration of arfolitixorin enhances the inhibition of DNA synthesis and increases the cytotoxic effect of 5-FU. As MTHF is the active form of folate and the active metabolite of LV and l-LV, arfolitixorin does not need to be converted to an active metabolite to become activated. In DNA synthesis, a ternary complex is formed between the reduced folate substrate MTHF, the TS enzyme and dUMP in order to convert dUMP to the DNA building block dTMP, which is necessary for DNA synthesis.","A dinucleotide antimetabolite composed of a decitabine linked via phosphodiester bond to a deoxyguanosine, with potential antineoplastic activity. Following metabolic activation via cleavage of the phosphodiester bond and incorporation of the decitabine moiety into DNA, guadecitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase, thereby causing non-specific, genome-wide hypomethylation, and induction of cell cycle arrest at S-phase. This agent is resistant to cytidine deaminase, which may result in gradual release of decitabine both extra- and intra-cellularly, leading to prolonged exposure to decitabine.","A uridine derivative and nucleoside analog with pro-apoptotic and chemosensitizing properties. In vitro, bromovinyl-deoxyuridine (BVDU) has been shown to downregulate the multifunctional DNA repair enzyme APEX nuclease 1, resulting in the inhibition of DNA repair and the induction of apoptosis. In addition, this agent may inhibit the expression of STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), which may result in the downregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). BVDU has also been found to inhibit the upregulation of chemoresistance genes (Mdr1 and DHFR) during chemotherapy. Overall, the gene expression changes associated with BVDU treatment result in the decrease or prevention of chemoresistance. In addition, this agent has been shown to enhance the cytolytic activity of NK-92 natural killer cells towards a pancreatic cancer cell line in vitro.","A folate analog antimetabolite with antineoplastic activity. As the 6R diastereomer of 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate, lometrexol inhibits glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis, arresting cells in the S phase of the cell cycle, and inhibiting tumor cell proliferation.  The agent has been shown to be active against tumors that are resistant to the folate antagonist methotrexate. (NCI04)","An antimetabolite and a chlorine derivative of the intracellular secondary messenger, cyclic adenosine 3,5-monophosphate (cAMP), with potential antineoplastic activity. Tocladesine appears to be converted to 8-chloro-adenosine by phosphodiesterases and subsequently phosphorylated to 8-chloro-ATP, which functions as a purine analogue and competes with ATP in transcription. In addition, generation of 8-chloro-ATP depletes endogenous ATP pool that is essential for many biological reactions in intracellular energy transfer. As a result, this agent causes RNA synthesis inhibition, blocks cellular proliferation, and induces apoptosis.","A synthetic pyrimidine nucleoside analogue with potential antineoplastic activity. Phosphorylated by cellular kinases, tezacitabine is converted into its active diphosphate and triphosphate metabolites. Tezacitabine diphosphate binds to and irreversibly inhibits the activity of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), which may result in the inhibition of DNA synthesis in tumor cells and tumor cell apoptosis. Tezacitabine triphosphate acts as a substrate for DNA polymerase, further compromising DNA replication. This agent is relatively resistant to metabolic deactivation by cytidine deaminase. RNR catalyzes the conversion of ribonucleoside 5'-diphosphates to deoxyribonucleoside 5'-diphosphates necessary for DNA synthesis and is overexpressed in many tumor types.","A small molecule pro-drug consisting of cytarabine, an antimetabolite analog of cytidine with a modified arabinose sugar moiety, covalently bonded to asparagine, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon intravenous administration, aspacytarabine targets cancer cells, which often lack asparagine synthetase and are dependent on an external source of amino acids due to their high metabolic rate. Once the prodrug is inside target cells, the cytarabine component is cleaved and competes with cytidine for incorporation into DNA. The arabinose sugar moiety of cytarabine sterically hinders the rotation of the molecule within DNA, resulting in cell cycle arrest, specifically during the S phase of replication. Cytarabine also inhibits DNA polymerase, resulting in a decrease in DNA replication and repair. Because BST-236 specifically targets cancer cells, it may spare normal tissues from cytarabine-related toxicities.","A synthetic pyrimidine nucleoside analogue with biomodulating activity. Tetrahydrouridine increases the efficacy of the radiosensitizer cytochlor (5-chloro-2'-deoxycytidine) by inhibiting the enzyme deoxycytidine monophosphate (dCMP) deaminase and preventing the premature deamination of the cytochlor metabolite 5-chloro-2'-deoxycytidine monophosphate (CldCMP) to 5-chloro-2'-deoxyuridine monophosphate (CldUMP); in turn, this increases tumor concentrations of CldUMP which is then further anabolized and incorporated selectively into tumor DNA as CldU (5-chloro-2'-deoxyuridine). (NCI04)","A 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (AICA) riboside, a ribnucleoside analog, and a nucleotide biosynthesis precursor with B cell pro-apoptotic activity. Following cellular uptake, acadesine is phosphorylated to AICA ribotide (ZMP), which mimics 5'-adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Both AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and AMPK kinase (AMPKK) are activated by ZMP, which appears to be necessary for the induction of apoptosis. Acadesine-induced apoptosis also appears to require cytochrome c release from mitochondria and caspase activation and is p53-independent. However, the exact mechanism of acadesine-induced apoptosis is unknown. T cells are significantly less susceptible than B cells to acadesine-induced apoptosis. AMPK regulates several cellular systems including the cellular uptake of glucose, the beta-oxidation of fatty acids, protein synthesis, and the biogenesis of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and mitochondria.","A purine nucleoside antimetabolite and antibiotic isolated from the fungus Cordyceps militaris with potential antineoplastic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. Cordycepin is an inhibitor of polyadenylation, activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and reduces mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, which may result in both the induction of tumor cell apoptosis and a decrease in tumor cell proliferation. mTOR, a serine/threonine kinase belonging to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-related kinase (PIKK) family, plays an important role in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway that regulates cell growth and proliferation, and its expression or activity is frequently dysregulated in human cancers.","An antimetabolite analogue of aminopterin with potential antineoplastic activity. As a folate antagonist, talotrexin binds to and inhibits the function of dihydrofolate reductase, resulting in the inhibition of folate metabolism, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Hydrosoluble, talotrexin is actively transported into cells by the reduced folate carrier (RFC) and, therefore, is unlikely to be associated with P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance.","An orally available small molecule and nucleoside antimetabolite with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, tRoducitabine is taken up by cells through a carrier-mediated transporter, phosphorylated by uridine cytidine kinase (UCK) and then further phosphorylated to its diphosphate (RX-DP) and triphosphate forms (RX-TP). The triphosphate form is incorporated into RNA and inhibits RNA synthesis. The diphosphate RX-DP is reduced by ribonucleotide reductase (RR) to dRX-DP; its triphosphate form (dRX-TP) is incorporated into DNA. In addition, RX-3117 also inhibits DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). This eventually leads to cell cycle arrest and the induction of apoptosis. UCK is the rate-limiting enzyme in the pyrimidine-nucleotide salvage pathway.","An orally available 5-substituted 2-pyrimidinone-2'-deoxyribonucleoside analogue and prodrug of 5-iododeoxyuridine (IUdR), an iodinated analogue of deoxyuridine, with radiosensitizing activity. Upon oral administration, ropidoxuridine (IPdR) is efficiently converted to idoxuridine (IUdR) by a hepatic aldehyde oxidase. In turn, IUdR is incorporated into DNA during replication, thereby sensitizing cells to ionizing radiation by increasing DNA strand breaks. Compared to IUdR, ropidoxuridine is associated with a lower toxicity profile and improved anti-tumor activity.","A lipophilic, unsaturated fatty acid ester derivative of gemcitabine (dFdC), an antimetabolite deoxynucleoside analogue, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon hydrolysis intracellularly by esterases, the prodrug gemcitabine is converted into the active metabolites difluorodeoxycytidine di- and tri-phosphate (dFdCDP and dFdCTP) by deoxycytidine kinase. dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, thereby decreasing the deoxynucleotide pool available for DNA synthesis; dFdCTP is incorporated into DNA, resulting in DNA strand termination and apoptosis. Due to its lipophilicity, gemcitabine 5'-elaidic acid ester exhibits an increased cellular uptake and accumulation, resulting in an increased conversion to active metabolites, compared to gemcitabine. In addition, this formulation of gemcitabine may be less susceptible to deamination and deactivation by deoxycytidine deaminase.","A phosphoramidate-based prodrug of the monophosphate (MP) form of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FUdR; FUDR), the active metabolite of fluorouracil (5-FU), an antimetabolite fluoropyrimidine analog of the pyrimidine nucleoside, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration of the nucleotide analog prodrug fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide, fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide is readily taken up by tumor cells. In the tumor cell, the phosphoramidate moiety is removed and fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide is converted to its active form FUDR-MP. In turn, FUDR-MP binds to and inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), resulting in the depletion of thymidine triphosphate (TTP) and thus DNA synthesis. With the phosphoramidate moiety attached to FUDR-MP, fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide, compared to 5-FU, is more lipophilic and accumulates in cancer cells by passive diffusion and does not require a nucleoside transporter, thereby generating higher intracellular concentrations. In addition, compared to 5-FU, once inside the cell FUDR-MP does not need to be phosphorylated and is already in its active form. Unlike 5-FU, fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide does not get deactivated or converted into toxic metabolites by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) and thymidine phosphorylase (TP), which leads to both a longer half-life and less toxicity.","An orally available valproic acid prodrug of gemcitabine, a broad-spectrum antimetabolite and deoxycytidine analogue with antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, gemcitabine prodrug LY2334737 is hydrolyzed by carboxylesterase 2 (CES2) and releases gemcitabine systemically over a period of time consistent with formation rate-limited kinetics. In turn, gemcitabine is converted into the active metabolites difluorodeoxycytidine diphosphate and triphosphate (dFdCDP and dFdCTP) by deoxycytidine kinase. dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, thereby decreasing the deoxynucleotide pool available for DNA replication; dFdCTP is incorporated into DNA, resulting in premature termination of DNA replication and eventually the induction of apoptosis. Compared to gemcitabine, this prodrug is able to avoid hydrolysis in enterocytes and the portal circulation thus avoiding first pass metabolism and increasing systemic gemcitabine availability. In addition, the slow release of gemcitabine may enhance efficacy while lowering toxicity. CES2, a serine ester hydrolase, is expressed in certain tumors which may allow for increased conversion of gemcitabine at the tumor site thus increases cytotoxicity.","An antimetabolite (pyrimidine analogue) antineoplastic derivative of 5-fluorouracil. (NCI)","A synthetic nucleoside analogue with antineoplastic activity. Tiazofurin (TR) is anabolized intracellularly to an analogue of NAD, tiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide (TAD), a potent inhibitor of IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH); IMPDH is the rate-limiting enzyme for de novo purine synthesis. Inhibition of IMPDH results in reduced levels of guanylates, resulting in the inhibition tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. (NCI04)","A purine nucleoside antimetabolite analogue. Cladribine triphosphate, a phosphorylated metabolite of cladribine, incorporates into DNA, resulting in single-strand breaks in DNA, depletion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and apoptosis.  Because this agent is resistant to adenosine deaminase, an enzyme that inactivates some antineoplastic agents, it is selectively toxic to lymphocytes and monocytes which exhibit little deoxynucleotide deaminase activity. (NCI04)","A synthetic nucleoside analogue with activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV. Intracellularly, lamivudine is phosphorylated to its active metabolites, lamiduvine triphosphate (L-TP) and lamiduvine monophosphate (L-MP).  In HIV, L-TP inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) via DNA chain termination after incorporation of the nucleoside analogue into viral DNA.  In HBV, incorporation of L-MP into viral DNA by HBV polymerase results in DNA chain termination. L-TP is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases alpha and beta, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase. (NCI04)","An arabinonucleoside antimetabolite with antineoplastic activity. Nelarabine is demethoxylated by adenosine deaminase to become biologically active 9-beta-D-arabinosylguanine (ara-G); ara-G incorporates into DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis and inducing an S phase-dependent apoptosis of tumor cells. (NCI04)","A bifunctional mechlorethamine derivative with alkylating and antimetabolite activities. Although the exact mechanism of action of bendamustine is unknown, this agent appears to alkylate and crosslink macromolecules, resulting in DNA, RNA and protein synthesis inhibition, and eventually the induction of apoptosis.","A synthetic prodrug of ganciclovir, a nucleoside analogue of 2'-deoxyguanosine, with antiviral activity. After phosphorylation, valganciclovir is incorporated into DNA, resulting in inhibition of viral DNA polymerase, viral DNA synthesis, and viral replication. (NCI04)","An orally available antimetabolite composed of the 1-ethoxymethyl derivative of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) inhibitor 3-cyano-2,6-dihydroxypyridine (CNDP) in a 1:1 molar ratio, with antineoplastic activity.  Upon administration, the prodrug emitefur is converted into 5-FU, while CNDP prevents the degradation of 5-FU by inhibiting DPYD and thereby prolonging the half-life of 5-FU. This increases 5-FU's concentration and thus its antitumor activity through inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis, as well as inhibition of thymidylate synthase activity. In addition, by inhibiting the formation of 5-FU metabolites, some toxic effects associated with these metabolites may be reduced. DPYD is the rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of 5-FU.","An amino acid analogue and antibiotic derived from the bacterium Streptomyces alanosinicus with antimetabolite and potential antineoplastic activities. L-alanosine inhibits adenylosuccinate synthetase, which converts inosine monophospate (IMP) into adenylosuccinate, an intermediate in purine metabolism. L-alanosine-induced disruption of de novo purine biosynthesis is potentiated by methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) deficiency. The clinical use of this agent may be limited by its toxicity profile. MTAP is a key enzyme in the adenine and methionine salvage pathways.","A analog of antimetabolite cytarabine (ara-C), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, thiarabine (T-araC) is phosphorylated to the triphosphate form T-araCTP and competes with cytidine for incorporation into DNA. This results in an inhibition of DNA replication and RNA synthesis, chain termination and may eventually decrease tumor cell proliferation. Compared to ara-C, T-araC appears to have a longer half-life and has a higher efficacy.","A purine nucleoside analogue with antineoplastic and antiviral activities.  By replacing guanine, dezaguanine incorporates into DNA and inhibits de novo purine synthesis, thereby inducing cell death. (NCI)","A fluorinated nucleotide antimetabolite analog of the antiviral agent vidarabine (ara-A) with antineoplastic activity. Administered parenterally as a phosphate salt, fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2-fluoro-ara-A and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2-fluoro-ara-ATP. This metabolite may inhibit DNA polymerase alpha, ribonucleotide reductase and DNA primase, thereby interrupting DNA synthesis and inhibiting tumor cell growth.  (NCI04)","A crystalline conjugate of folic acid, having general properties of a polypeptide. Pteropterin differs from folic acid in that it consists of three molecules of glutamic acid instead of one. Pteropterin can potentially be used as an antimetabolite in the treatment of cancer.","A sulfhydryl analog of inosine and an antimetabolite with potential antineoplastic and immunosuppressive properties. Thioinosine interferes with de novo purine synthesis and perturbs the pool of nucleotides necessary for DNA replication. As a result, this agent inhibits DNA synthesis, blocks cellular proliferation and induces apoptosis.","A fluorinated heterocyclic 2-ring compound. 2-fluoroadenine is the base moiety for many carbocyclic and acyclic nucleoside analogues, which may be used in antineoplastic studies.","The sodium salt of a synthetic antimetabolite analogue of folate with antineoplastic activity.  Emfolin sodium competes for the folate binding site of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, resulting in inhibition of tetrahydrofolate synthesis, depletion of nucleotide pools, and inhibition of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis. (NCI04)","A combination of the thiosemicarbazone 3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde (3-AP) and the nucleoside analogue fludarabine with antineoplastic activity. The agents in 3-AP/fludarabine, act synergistically to inhibit the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase.. Composed of two subunits, this enzyme catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides. The 3-AP binds to and inactivates one subunit while fludarabine binds to and inactivates the other.  Fludarabine also inhibits DNA polymerase alpha and DNA primase. At low concentrations, this agent arrests tumor cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle; at higher concentrations, in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. (NCI04)","Any fluoropyrimidine-based agent with potential antineoplastic activity. As an antimetabolite, a fluoropyrimidine interferes with pyrimidine utilization and incorporation into DNA and RNA.","An orally bioavailable formulation of azacitidine, a pyrimidine nucleoside analogue of cytidine, with antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, azacitidine is taken up by cells and metabolized to 5-azadeoxycitidine triphosphate. The incorporation of 5-azadeoxycitidine triphosphate into DNA reversibly inhibits DNA methyltransferase, and blocks DNA methylation. Hypomethylation of DNA by azacitidine may re-activate tumor suppressor genes previously silenced by hypermethylation, resulting in an antitumor effect. In addition, the incorporation of 5-azacitidine triphosphate into RNA disrupts normal RNA function and impairs tRNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase activity, resulting in an inhibition of RNA and protein synthesis.","The disodium salt form of N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA), a pyrimidine antimetabolite with antineoplastic activity.  PALA inhibits pyrimidine biosynthesis and increases the extent to which fluorouracil is incorporated into RNA. (NCI04)","An antimetabolite analogue of purine with antineoplastic and immuno-suppressant properties.  9H-Purine-6Thio-98D substitutes for the normal nucleoside and fraudulently incorporates into DNA and inhibits de novo purine synthesis, thereby inducing cell death. In vivo, this agent, also known as 6MP-arabinoside, may occur as a metabolite of the antineoplastic agent mercaptopurine. (NCI04)","An aerosol inhalation formulation containing gemcitabine (GCB), a broad-spectrum antimetabolite and deoxycytidine analogue, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon inhalation via a nebulizer, GCB is converted intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to its active metabolites difluorodeoxycytidine di- and triphosphate (dFdCDP, dFdCTP). dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), thereby decreasing the deoxynucleotide pool available for DNA synthesis; dFdCTP competes with deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) and is incorporated into DNA, resulting in DNA strand termination and the induction of apoptosis of lung tumor cells. GCB administration directly into the lungs via aerosol yields higher concentrations of GCB locally than can be achieved by systemic GCB administration, potentially reducing systemic toxicity.","An antimetabolite with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, FF-10502 is able to enter the nucleus where it inhibits DNA polymerases, thereby preventing DNA synthesis and halting tumor cell proliferation.","The triphosphate salt of cordycepin, a purine nucleoside antimetabolite and antibiotic isolated from the fungus Cordyceps militaris with potential antineoplastic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. Cordycepin is an inhibitor of polyadenylation, activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and reduces mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, which may result in both the induction of tumor cell apoptosis and a decrease in tumor cell proliferation. mTOR, a serine/threonine kinase belonging to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-related kinase (PIKK) family, plays an important role in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway that regulates cell growth and proliferation, and its expression or activity is frequently dysregulated in human cancers.","An antimetabolite consisting of a fluorinated pyrimidine analog with potential antineoplastic activity. As a prodrug, 5-fluoro-2-deoxycytidine is converted by intracellular deaminases to the cytotoxic agent 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). 5-FU is subsequently metabolized to active metabolites including 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP). FdUMP binds to and inhibits thymidylate synthase, thereby reducing the production of thymidine monophosphate, which leads to depletion of thymidine triphosphate. This inhibits DNA synthesis and cell division. FUTP competes with uridine triphosphate for incorporation into the RNA strand thus leading to an inhibition of RNA and protein synthesis. Other fluorouracil metabolites also get incorporated into both DNA and RNA, thereby further hampering cellular growth.","A conjugate containing the antimetabolite and antifolate agent methotrexate conjugated to insulin-like growth factor (IGF), with potential antineoplastic activity. After intravenous administration, the IGF moiety of the IGF-methotrexate conjugate binds to and is internalized by IGF receptors (IGFR) on the surface of tumor cells. Following cell entry, the methotrexate then binds to and inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. This results in both the inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis and the induction of death in rapidly dividing cells. Binding to IGFR can localize the cytotoxic effect of methotrexate in tumor cells. This may increase its efficacy while decreasing its toxicity to normal, healthy cells. IGFR is overexpressed on many types of cancer cells and has been implicated in metastasis and resistance to apoptosis.","An oral formulation of the phosphate salt of fludarabine, a synthetic purine nucleoside analogue antimetabolite with antineoplastic activity. Fudarabine is preferentially transported into malignant cells and metabolized by deoxycytidine kinase to its active form, 2-fluoro-ara-ATP; 2-fluoro-ara-ATP competes directly with deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) and inhibits alpha DNA polymerase, RNA reductase, and DNA primase, which may result in inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell death.","Treatment of cancer that utilizes antimetabolite substances to disrupt DNA, RNA, or protein synthesis.","An orally available fixed-dose combination agent containing cedazuridine, a cytidine deaminase (CDA) inhibitor, and the cytidine antimetabolite decitabine, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration of tdecitabine and cedazuridine, cedazuridine binds to and inhibits CDA, an enzyme primarily found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and liver that catalyzes the deamination of cytidine and cytidine analogs. This prevents the breakdown of decitabine, increases its bioavailability and efficacy while decreasing GI toxicity due to the administration of lower doses of decitabine. Decitabine exerts its antineoplastic activity through the incorporation of its triphosphate form into DNA, which inhibits DNA methyltransferase and results in hypomethylation of DNA. This interferes with DNA replication and decreases tumor cell growth.","An orally bioavailable inhibitor of both deoxyuridine triphosphatase (dUTPase) and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), with potential antineoplastic adjuvant activity. Upon oral administration in combination with a prodrug of the pyrimidine antagonist 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), TAS-114 inhibits (DPD), the liver enzyme responsible for rapid catabolism of 5-FU into inactive metabolites. This prevents first-pass metabolism of 5-FU, allowing oral administration of the 5-FU prodrug and increasing the efficacy of 5-FU. In addition, as a dUTPase inhibitor, TAS-114 enhances the antitumor activity of 5-FU by preventing the hydrolysis and breakdown of 5-fluoro-deoxyuridine triphosphate (FdUTP) and deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP), which are active metabolites of 5-FU. This promotes DNA polymerase-dependent incorporation of these antimetabolites into DNA and leads to DNA damage and tumor cell death. Co-administration with TAS-114 allows lower dosing of 5-FU prodrugs, which decreases 5-FU-related toxicity, while maintaining therapeutic levels of 5-FU at the tumor site.","An oral suspension containing the thiopurine-derivative antimetabolite 6-mercaptopurine, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, mercaptopurine is metabolized by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase) to its active metabolite 6-thioinosine monophosphate (TIMP); TIMP inhibits nucleotide interconversions and de novo purine ribonucleotide synthesis, which both blocks the formation of purine nucleotides and inhibits DNA synthesis. This agent is also incorporated into DNA in the form of deoxythioguanosine, which results in the disruption of DNA replication. By blocking DNA synthesis and replication, cancer cells are unable to proliferate. Compared to the tablet formulation, the liquid is easier to swallow and offers more flexibility and accuracy in dosing, which is beneficial for use in pediatric patients.","A combination tablet of ethynyluracil and fluorouracil. Fluorouracil is an antimetabolite fluoropyrimidine analog of the nucleoside pyrimidine with antineoplastic activity. Ethynyluracil is an orally-active fluoropyrimidine analog that inhibits dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme that catabolizes and inactivates 5-fluorouracil in the liver. This may lead to an increase in the bioavailability and, effectiveness of fluorouracil.","An orally available nanoparticle-based formulation containing the hydrochloride salt form of gemcitabine, a broad-spectrum antimetabolite and deoxycytidine analogue, with antineoplastic activity. The formulation consists of an oil-in-water emulsion in which gemicitabine is solubilized in the excipient matrix containing a mixture of oil and (co)surfactants. Upon oral administration, gemcitabine is converted into the active metabolites difluorodeoxycytidine diphosphate (dFdCDP) and difluorodeoxycytidine triphosphate (dFdCTP) by deoxycytidine kinase. dFdCTP competes with deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) and is incorporated into DNA, resulting in premature termination of DNA replication and the induction of apoptosis. Further, dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase and reduces the deoxynucleotide pool available for DNA synthesis. Compared to gemcitabine alone, the emulsion allows for increased oral bioavailability and decreases its susceptibility to deamination and deactivation by cytidine deaminase.","A synthetic conjugate composed of the bisphosphonate etidronate linked to the cytostatic agent and antimetabolite cytarabine, with potential antineoplastic and antiresorptive activities. Upon intravenous administration of the etidronate-cytarabine conjugate MBC-11, the etidronate moiety targets bone and the two moieties are released upon hydrolysis. Etidronate binds to hydroxyapatite crystals in bone tissues and prevents its resorption. This prevents bone destruction and induces bone cell mineralization. In addition, the bone-targeting nature of this agent allows for the accumulation of cytarabine in bone tissue, where it is able to exert its antitumor effect locally by competing with cytidine for incorporation into DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis, while reducing systemic exposure. This leads to a destruction of bone-associated tumor cells, an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and bone metastasis, and prevents tumor-mediated bone destruction.","A prodrug of the monophosphate (MP) form of the antimetabolite cytarabine (araCMP), an analogue of cytidine with a modified sugar moiety (arabinose instead of ribose), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon administration of the cytarabine MP prodrug MB07133, the targeting moiety of this agent specifically delivers the cytarabine moiety to the liver. In turn, araCMP is selectively converted to araC triphosphate (araCTP) by a liver kinase, where it binds to and competes with cytidine for incorporation into DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA polymerase, and DNA synthesis. This leads to the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and destruction of liver cancer cells. The liver is not able to convert araC into araCMP; araCMP is not converted into araCTP in tissues other than the liver. This enhances efficacy and minimizes systemic toxicity.","An orally bioavailable combination agent composed of the cytotoxic pyrimidine analog trifluridine (5-trifluoro-2'-deoxythymidine or TFT) and a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor (TPI) tipiracil hydrochloride, in a molar ratio of 1.0:0.5 (TFT:TPI), with potential antineoplastic activity. After oral administration of TAS-102, TFT is phosphorylated to the active monophosphate form TF-TMP, which binds covalently to the active site of thymidylate synthase, thereby reducing the nucleotide pool levels required for DNA replication. Furthermore, the triphosphate form TF-TTP can be incorporated into DNA, which induces DNA fragmentation and leads to the inhibition of tumor growth. TPI exhibits a dual effect: 1) an anti-angiogenic effect mediated through the inhibition of thymidine phosphorylase, which plays important role in nucleotide metabolism and a variety of development processes, including angiogenesis, 2) increased bioavailability of the normally short-lived antimetabolite TFT by preventing its degradation into the inactive form trifluorothymine (TF-Thy). The synergistic effect of the components in TAS-10 may demonstrate antitumor activity in 5-FU-resistant cancer cells.","A controlled-release intravesical system consisting of a small flexible tube-like device with a solid core composed of gemcitabine, a broad-spectrum antimetabolite and deoxycytidine analogue, with antineoplastic activity. Upon placement of the gemcitabine-releasing intravesical system (GemRIS) into the bladder, gemcitabine is gradually and continuously released from the system over an extended period of time before being removed from the bladder. Upon release, gemcitabine is converted into the active metabolites difluorodeoxycytidine diphosphate (dFdCDP) and difluorodeoxycytidine triphosphate (dFdCTP) by deoxycytidine kinase. dFdCTP competes with deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) and is incorporated into DNA, resulting in premature termination of DNA replication and the induction of apoptosis of bladder tumor cells. In addition, dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) and reduces the deoxynucleotide pool available for DNA synthesis.","A rapidly disintegrating film-coated tablet composed of the fluoropyrimidine carbamate antimetabolite capecitabine with antineoplastic activity. As a prodrug, capecitabine is converted to 5'-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine (5'-DFCR) by hepatic carboxylesterase and then to 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5'-DFUR) by cytidine deaminase and is eventually activated by thymidine phosphorylase to its cytotoxic moiety, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU); subsequently, 5-FU is metabolized to two active metabolites, 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP). FdUMP inhibits DNA synthesis and cell division by reducing normal thymidine triphosphate production, while FUTP inhibits RNA and protein synthesis by competing with uridine triphosphate for incorporation into the RNA strand. Capecitabine rapidly disintegrating tablet (RDT) contains the water insoluble, disintegrating agent crospovidone which very rapidly disperses and swells in water making this RDT easier to swallow than the traditional capecitabine tablet.","A liposomal formulation containing a fixed combination of the antineoplastic agents cytarabine and daunorubicin in a 5:1 molar ratio. Liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine has been designed to provide optimal delivery of a specific ratio of cytarabine to daunorubicin, one that has been shown to be synergistic in vitro. The antimetabolite cytarabine competes with cytidine for incorporation into DNA, inhibiting DNA synthesis. This agent also inhibits DNA polymerase, resulting in a decrease in DNA replication and repair. Daunorubicin, an intercalator and a topoisomerase II inhibitor, prevents DNA replication and inhibits protein synthesis. This agent also generates oxygen free radicals, resulting in the cytotoxic lipid peroxidation of cell membrane lipids.","An orally available fixed-dose combination agent containing cedazuridine, a cytidine deaminase (CDA) inhibitor, and the cytidine antimetabolite azacitidine, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration of the cedazuridine/azacitidine combination agent ASTX030, cedazuridine binds to and inhibits CDA, an enzyme primarily found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and liver that catalyzes the deamination of cytidine and cytidine analogs. This prevents the breakdown of azacitidine, increases its bioavailability and efficacy while decreasing GI toxicity due to the administration of lower doses of azacitidine. Azacitidine exerts its antineoplastic activity through the incorporation of its triphosphate form into DNA, which inhibits DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), thereby blocking DNA methylation and results in hypomethylation of DNA. This interferes with DNA replication and decreases tumor cell growth.","A suspension of autologous tumor-derived microparticles (ATMP), that are harvested from a patient with malignant pleural effusion, encapsulating the antimetabolic drug methotrexate (MTX), with potential anticancer activity. Although the exact mechanism(s) of action through which this agent exerts its effect has yet to be fully elucidated, upon administration of MTX-ATMP, the MTX moiety is released and internalized by tumor cells. It then binds to and inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. This results in the inhibition of purine nucleotide synthesis and leads to decreased synthesis of both DNA and RNA, which induces cell death. Presumably, the encapsulation of MTX by the ATMP improves its bioavailability and decreases its toxicity.","An orally bioavailable granular formulation composed of the fluoropyrimidine antagonist tegafur combined with two modulators of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) activity, gimeracil and oteracil potassium, and the folic acid derivative leucovorin calcium, with potential antineoplastic activity. Tegafur is a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), an antimetabolite that is further metabolized to 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP). FdUMP inhibits thymidylate synthase, DNA synthesis and cell division; FUTP competes with uridine triphosphate (UTP), thus inhibiting RNA and protein synthesis. Gimeracil is a reversible inhibitor of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), the liver enzyme responsible for rapid catabolism of 5-FU into inactive metabolites. Oteracil potassium preferentially localizes in the gut and inhibits the enzyme orotate phosphoribosyl-transferase (OPRT), which converts tegafur to 5-FU. This decreases the amount of 5-FU in the gut and prevents activated 5-FU-related gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity.
